<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been requested, from time to time, by my
numerous patients and friends to publish some record of
the Bone-setter’s art, to which they can refer their relatives
and acquaintances, when asked for some particulars
of the cures effected and the pain alleviated by those who
follow the profession of a Bone-setter. I am aware that
in acceding to the request of those who “have the courage
of their convictions,” I am laying myself open to the
sneers and innuendos of the medical profession generally;
but as the descendant of a long line of Bone-setters, who
distinguished themselves in the profession they followed,
<span class="pagenum">viii</span>
and whose name was a “household word” in Midland
homes when broken bones, sprains, and dislocations
occurred. I feel, as the inheritor of their practice and in
some degree of their reputation, that I should not be true
to myself and to the profession I follow, if I did not
comply with a request so gracefully made by those who have
not only placed their faith in the special practice I
pursue, but who are grateful for the relief from pain they
have felt, the ultimate cures effected, and who wish to
make their experiences widely known.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with diffidence that I collected from
divers sources the testimony of those who are beyond the
reach of suspicion, as to the cures which those who practise
the “Art of the Bone-setter” have accomplished,
even after experienced surgeons have failed; but I was
reassured when I found that these recorded cures, and the
repute of the hundreds of thousands which have not been
recorded, but which are treasured in the memories of a
thankful people, had aroused a feeling of emulation (for I
can hardly use any other term) in the surgical world to
adopt some of our methods, which up to a recent period,
they had publicly called the arts of the charlatan and the
quack, and resolved to practise in that “neglected corner
<span class="pagenum">ix</span>
of the domain of surgery” which they had before
ridiculed. They did not hesitate to apply terms of
approbrium to us when they were, according to their own
admission, ignorant of our practice, attributing our cures
to “luck” and our popularity to tampering with and
trading on the prejudices of the poor and ignorant,
instead of inquiring into their truth.</p>

<p>Dr. Wharton Hood in his treatise “On Bone-setting
(so-called)” has pointed out that even Sir James Paget
(eminent though he is in the surgical world) spoke in
ignorance when, in a clinical lecture delivered at St.
Bartholomew’s in 1867, he detailed the “Cases that
Bone-setters may cure.” His arguments were founded
on conjecture, therefore many of his conclusions were
wrong. The great master of the world of surgery, however,
deserves the thanks of the Bone-setters at large, for
he was the first to stand forth in the whole of the medical
profession to announce that the much despised and
ridiculed Bone-setters were in possession of a “knack”&mdash;an
art&mdash;which surgeons had long overlooked and neglected
which tended to alleviate pain and to restore the use of
lost limbs to unfortunate sufferers from accidents and
other external injuries. Dr. Wharton Hood appears to
<span class="pagenum">x</span>
have taken Sir James Paget’s words to heart, for becoming
acquainted with the late Mr. Richard Hutton, the well-known
Bone-setter, whose name so frequently appears in
these pages, he studied his method of procedure and
practice. On the death of that gentleman, Dr. Hood
published his experiences with diagrams, and since that
period&mdash;now some dozen years ago a change has taken
place in the expression of professional opinion with respect
to the art of the Bone-setter. There is no attempt
now to deny that in practical surgery, that what is called
the Empirical School, can hold its own against mere
scientific theory. They have vindicated our art from
the charge of quackery and charlatanism. It would now
appear they now want to secure our practice as well
as our reputation as skillful manipulators. I feel therefore
I am more than justified in thus publishing the
testimony of relieved patients, of the almost recantation
of the faculty with respect to our art, to justify those
who have trusted our skill and who have seen no cause
to regret it.</p>

<p>There may, indeed, be persons who call themselves
bone-setters, who are ignorant, presumptuous, and destitute
alike of skill and experience, whose blunders
<span class="pagenum">xi</span>
are charged on the profession generally&mdash;there may be
many such whose names are even in the <i>Medical
Registry</i>&mdash;but no one can read the testimony of men
beyond the reach of bribe, and who have no personal
interest to serve, without admitting that there are Bone-setters
who have both skill and experience as well as the
ability to use their acquirements for the benefit of
suffering mankind. The art, it is true, may not be
taught in schools, but it is at least as old as Hippocrates,
if not coeval with mankind’s “loss of Eden.” I have felt
it a duty to myself, to my relatives, to my patients and
friends, as well as to my fellow professors of the art to
publish this testimony and vindication.</p>

<p>I have acknowledged as far as possible the sources from
which I have taken the information in the following
pages, if any have been accidentally omitted, I hope
this apology will be sufficient. To those friends who
have helped me with their advice and supervision of these
pages I tender my warmest thanks, as well as to those
patients who have offered their testimony to my own
skill and success, and allowed me to add them to those
collected from public sources for this book, as Turner
wrote in his edition to “The Compleat Bone-setter”
<span class="pagenum">xii</span>
some two hundred years ago is not intended for
Sutorian or Scissarium doctors, but I leave them amongst
the Caco-Chymists, to boast of their <i>arcanas</i>, but not of
their reason, whilst I shall modestly remain</p>

<small><i>BONE-SETTERS AND THEIR ART.</i></small></h2>

<p><small>“At present my desire is to have a good Bone-setter.”&mdash;<i>Sir J.
Denham.</i></small></p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> words, which Dr. Johnson used to illustrate the
word Bone-setter in his famous dictionary, are better
known than any other quotation bearing on the ancient
art of the Bone-setter. There are scattered through the
realms of English literature frequent allusions to those,
who, in times past, practised this special branch of the
surgical art, for the art is as old as the history of civilization
itself, and was probably coeval with the fall of man.
The assuaging of pain and the cure of injuries caused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
external violence would naturally excite the ingenuity of
the sufferer and suggest contrivances to those around
them. The Egyptians are credited with a knowledge of
surgery, though they appear to have relied on incantation
and astrology for their medical practice. It is somewhat
curious that one of our leading medical journals should
have suggested, within a brief period, that Bone-setters
likewise had recourse to charms and magic&mdash;thus credulity,
in those who would ridicule the credulous, repeats
itself even in these enlightened days. The intermediate
history of surgery is full of strange changes and mutations;
but, apart from the ordinary practices of the art, (with its
cauterization and its cruel operations,) the cure of sprains,
the reducing of dislocations and fractures, appears to have
been practised by those who were neither leeches or barber-chirurgeons.
In the seventeenth century when Harvey
was studying the circulation of the blood, and Wiseman
publishing those treatises which are the foundation of the
modern system of surgery, one Friar Moulton had published
<i>The Compleat Bone-setter</i>, and in the year 1665
an edition of it, “Englished and Enlarged” by Robert
Turner, was printed for Thomas Rooks, of the “Lamb
and Ink Bottle” at the East-end of St. Pauls. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
not been able to trace any separate publication on this
subject during the two centuries which intervened between
it and the work by Dr. Wharton Hood, which was
issued in 1871, in a separate volume, after the greater
part of it had appeared in the <i>Lancet</i>. Before the publication
of this work, the poor Bone-setter had to endure
contumely and insult at the hands of the faculty. Through
their organs in the press they were denounced either as
charlatans or quacks&mdash;as ignorant or presumptuous individuals
who traded upon a “lucky” case to the detriment
of the general practitioner. There were some, indeed, who
by intercourse and observation knew that Bone-setters pursued
their calling with success; that the principles which
they followed were sound, gained by experience and improved
by constant practise; that they possessed, in the
different parts of the country where they lived, the confidence
of the people, though they were not educated in
the medical or surgical schools. They received their
training at the hands of their predecessors, for the art
was a special one and peculiar to several families whose
traditions, observation, and method of practise were
handed down from father to son. Daughters practised
the art with success as well as the sons, and success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
crowned their efforts, and amongst them all the family of
Matthews were pre-eminent in the Midlands, and whose
representative I have the honour and privilege to be.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Waterton, of Walton Hall, the eminent
naturalist, who bears testimony to the good the Bone-setters
have done, tells us, in the pleasant autobiographical
notes to his <i>Wanderings and Essays on Natural History</i>&mdash;that
every country in Europe, so far as I know to
the contrary, has its Bone-setter independent of the
surgeon. In <i>Johnson’s Dictionary</i>, under the article
“Bone-setting,” we read that a Sir John Denham
exclaimed “Give me a good Bone-setter!” In Spain the
Bone-setter goes under the significant denomination of
Algebusta. Here in England, however, the vast increase
of practitioners in the art of surgery appears to have
placed the old original Bone-setter in the shade; and
I myself in many instances, have heard this most
useful member of society designated as a mere quack;
but most unjustly so, because a quack is generally considered
as one devoid of professional education, and he is
too apt to deal in spurious medicines. But not so the
Bone-setter, whose extensive and almost incessant practice
makes ample amends for the loss of anything that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
might have acquired, by attending a regular course of
lectures, or by culling the essence of abstruse and scientific
publications. With him theory seems to be a mere
trifle. Practice&mdash;daily and assiduous practice&mdash;is what
renders him so successful in the most complicated cases.
By the way in which you put your foot to the ground, by
the manner in which you handle an object, the Bone-setter,
through the mere faculty of his sight, oftentimes
without even touching the injured part, will tell you
where the ailment lies. Those only, who have personally
experienced the skill of the Bone-setter, can form a true
estimation of his merit in managing fractures and reducing
dislocations. Further than this, his services in the
healing and restorative art would never be looked at.
This last is entirely the province of Galen and his
numerous family of practitioners. Wherefore, at the
time that I unequivocally avow to have the uttermost
respect for the noble art of surgery in all its ramifications,
I venture to reserve to myself the following (without any
disparagement to the learned body of gentlemen who
profess it) sincere esteem for the old practitioners who do
so much for the public good amongst the lower orders,
under the denomination of British Bone-setters. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
people have complained to me of the rude treatment they
have experienced at the hands of the Bone-setter; but
let these complainants bear in mind, what has been
undone by force must be replaced by force; and that
gentle and emollient applications, although essentially
necessary in the commencement, and also in the continuation
of the treatment, would ultimately be of no avail,
without the final application of actual force to the injured
parts. Hence the intolerable and excruciating pain on
these occasions. The actual state of the accident is to
blame&mdash;not the operation. The thanks of every Bone-setter
is due to the eminent naturalist for his testimony
of the value of, and his vindication of, the art they practise.
His own quoted case is a peculiar one, but the
experience of every Bone-setter could furnish a parallel
and even more surprising instances of cures effected when
the resources of scientific surgery have failed.</p>

<p>Of the older Bone-setters we find some extraordinary
accounts, and evidently not penned by friendly hands.
One of the most famous of the Bone-setters of the last
century was Mrs. Mapp, of Epsom, who was the daughter
of a Bone-setter named Wallin, of Hindon, Wiltshire.
The accounts of her life and career, which have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
down to us, are very contradictory. For instance, the
<i>London Magazine</i> tells us that in August, 1736, the
town was surprised with the fame of a young woman
at Epsom, who, though not very regular in her conduct
(so it was said) wrought such cures that seem
miraculous in the Bone-setting way. The concourse of
people to Epsom on this occasion is incredible, and it is
reckoned she gets nearly 20 guineas a day, she executing
what she does in a very quick manner. She has strength
enough to put in any man’s shoulder without any assistance;
and thus her strength makes the following story
the more probable. A man came to her, sent, as is
supposed by some surgeons, on purpose to try her skill,
with his hand bound up, and pretended his wrist was
put out, which upon examination she found to be false;
but, to be even with him in his imposition, she gave it a
wrench which really put it out, and bade him <i>go to the
fools who sent him and get it set again</i>, or, if he would
come to her that day month, she would do it herself. It
is further stated that since she became famous she married
one Mr. Hill Mapp, late servant to a mercer on Ludgatehill
who, it is said, soon left her and carried off £100 of
her money. Her professional success, however, says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
another account, must have gone far to solace her for
matrimonial failure. Besides driving a profitable trade
at home, she used to drive to town once a week in a
coach-and-four, and return again bearing away the
crutches of her patients as trophies of honour. She held
her levees at the “Grecian” Coffee House, where she
operated successfully upon a niece of Sir Hans Sloane.
The same day she straightened the body of a man whose
back had stuck out two inches for nine years; and a
gentleman who went into the house with one shoe-heel
six inches high came out again cured of a lameness of
twenty years standing, and with both his legs of equal
length. It does not appear that she was always so successful,
for one Thomas Barber, tallow-chandler, of
Saffron-hill, thought proper to publish a warning to her
would-be patients. The cure of Sir Hans Sloane’s
niece made Mrs. Mapp town talk, and, if it was only
known that she intended to make one of the audience, the
theatre favoured with her presence, was crowded to
excess. A comedy was announced at the Lincoln’s Inn
Fields Theatre, called <i>The Husband’s Relief; or the
Female Bone-setter, and the Worm Doctor</i>. Mrs. Mapp
attended the first night, and was gratified at hearing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
song in her praise, of which we give two verses as a
specimen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">You surgeons of London who puzzle your pates</div>
<div class="line">To ride in your coaches and purchase estates;</div>
<div class="line">Give over, for shame, for your pride has a fall,</div>
<div class="line">And the doctress of Epsom has outdone you all.</div>
<div class="line">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="line">Dame Nature has given her a doctor’s degree,</div>
<div class="line">She gets all the patients and pockets the fee;</div>
<div class="line">So if you don’t instantly prove it a cheat,</div>
<div class="line">She’ll loll in a chariot whilst you walk the street.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mrs. Mapp soon afterwards removed from Epsom to Pall
Mall, but she did not forget her country friends. She
gave a plate of 10 guineas to be run for at Epsom, and
went to see the race. Singularly enough the first heat
was won by a mare called “Mrs. Mapp,” which so
delighted the doctress, that she gave the jockey a guinea,
and promised to make it a 100 if he won the plate, but
to his chagrin he failed to do so. The fair Bone-setter’s
career was but a brief one. In 1736 she was at the
height of her prosperity, yet, strange to say, she died at
the end of 1737 in miserable circumstances, as set forth
in a paragraph in the <i>London Daily Post</i> of December
22nd, 1737. The success and reputation of Mrs. Mapp
has met with a parallel in our own day. Just at the
time when Dr. Wharton Hood was showing the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
surgeons how to imitate the practice and cures of the
Bone-setter, the medical journals gave prominence to the
doings and manipulation of a female Bone-setter named
Regina Dal Cin, who had astonished the surgical world
both in Italy and Austria. Dr. A. Joannides<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> describes
her manipulations which he witnessed in company with
many hundreds of medical men and students in the
Ospedal Civico at Trieste. He says, “No case of reductions
of the femur were witnessed by me. Many cases
of muscular rigidity of the upper and lower extremities,
and more especially of the small articulations, have been
either completely and instantaneously cured or partially
ameliorated. No attempt has been made in cases of old
dislocations with fistulas or scars.” Her doings excited
some attention even in this country. We are told that
she was an intelligent looking woman, about fifty-five
years of age, and that she had practised the art, which
had been taught her by her mother and grandfather for
about forty years at a place named Vittoria, in the province
of Treviso. After the death of her mother, she
joined her brother, who kept a public-house, where she
exercised her skill on the lame and the crippled frequen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>ters
of the establishment, and effected a number of cures.
A medical eye witness tells us that her activity, flexibility,
and sensibility of the tips of her fingers, and her habit of
incessantly talking to the patient whilst operating, are
the qualities on which her success in operating depends.
Gradually coming into notice among persons of various
classes of society, she obtained a wide spread of reputation,
and visited among other places, Venice, Trieste,
Pesth, and Vienna. In each place crowds of patients,
both belonging to the locality and coming from a distance
flocked to her. She professed especially to treat deformities
of the hip joint, even reducing dislocations of
long standing, whether congenital or acquired. She does
not operate except in the presence of a surgeon. This,
according to one account of her, was a measure taken for
her own safety, as she was once interfered with by the
Austrian law for practising without a legal qualification.
A Royal Commissary of the district of Vittoria, however,
gave her permission to practice the reduction of human
joints, and especially of femoral luxations, provided that
she operated in the presence of a physician. The <i>British
Medical Journal</i> devoted some space to Regina Dal Cin’s
method of procedure which shows that she practised on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
similar grounds to the English Bone-setter, as detailed in
these pages. We are told by the journal in question she
first applies poultices for some days, for the purpose of
softening the tissues; this having been effected to her
satisfaction, she operates by rapidly performed process of
manipulation. Professional opinion was divided as to her
merits. Her supporters alleged that her cures, including
the reduction of old dislocations, were genuine; that&mdash;as
Dr. Schivardi of Milan observes&mdash;“science ought to
be grateful to her for having amply demonstrated by a
vast number of facts (1) that dislocations even of long
standing can be cured without recourse to any great violence,
or to the ponderous instruments hitherto deemed
indispensable; (2) that small and modest apparatus
suffice, after the operation, to keep the limb in its place&mdash;nay,
are more efficacious than strong instruments; (3)
that quiet and absolute repose for eight days, and moderate
repose for other twenty days, suffices to enable
Nature to bring to the new domicile given to the head of
the joint all the materials necessary for the fabrication of
the fresh ligaments required.” On the other hand her
opponents, more or less, denied her cures, and considered
her an impostor. Dr. Neudoorfer, apparently admitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
some of her cures of ankylosed hip-joint, states that the
method which she follows is nearly the same as the process
of “apolipsis,” recommended and practised by him several
years ago, for the removal of fibrous ankylosis. She
paid a visit to Vienna, where her proceedings attracted a
good deal of attention, and gave rise, to some degree, of
controversy in medical circles. A specially appointed
committee accompanied her in her visits to four patients,
and their report was unfavourable to her pretensions, and
resulted in the withdrawal of the permission given to
practice in Vienna.</p>

<p>A few months prior to these experiments in Vienna,
there died at Watford, one of the best known bone-setters,
Mr. Richard Hutton of Watford, Herts. The <i>Lancet</i> in
recording his decease on January 6th, 1871, makes the
following admission in a very different tone it assumed
barely two years before. It calls him a successful bone-setter,
for “successful he certainly was, and it were folly
to deny it, in some cases which had baffled the skill of the
best surgeons; but his failures were many, though these
of course were little heard of. Following the general
practice of bone-setters he diagnosed a dislocation, or
several dislocations, in every case in which he was con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>sulted;
and when, fortunately, the case was one of chronic
thickness about a joint, with possibly partial ankylosis
or adhesion of tendons, the greatest success attended his
rough manipulations in many instances. Every now and
then Hutton got into difficulties by attacking an acutely
inflamed joint, or by lighting up mischief in an old
case; but as a rule he was too cautious thus to be caught
out. We have seen some of his successes and some of his
failures, and the redeeming feature about him was that
though an empiric, he was not an extortionate one, and
in many cases refused remuneration altogether.”</p>

<p>It was through this Mr. Hutton that the <i>Lancet</i> was
enabled to publish a portion of the system practised by
him, and which has been since partly followed by the
faculty; but even the <i>Lancet</i>, after admitting the skill of
the Bone-setters and their success, cannot repress the
habitual sneer at their successful and humble operations.
We have an instance of this, when recording the death in
May, 1875, of a celebrated Bone-setter, of the name of
Burbidge, who died in Frimley, Surrey, where local tradition
ascribed numerous cures to his manipulative skill.
“We do not know” says the leading medical organ
“whether any <i>spells</i> or <i>incantations</i> were used at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
ceremonies in which he operated, as practised by some of
his genus!” The writer must have been dreaming of
the medical practitioners in the time of the Pharaohs
when he penned this. Mr. Burbidge’s father and grandfather
were celebrated Bone-setters.</p>

<p>Another famous and “good Bone-setter” is recorded
by Mr. C. Waterton, in his <i>Essays on Natural History</i>
before quoted: “About half a mile from Wakefield’s
Mammoth Prison, on the Halifax Road, nearly opposite
to a pretty Grecian summer-house, apparently neglected,
resides Mr. Joseph Crowther, the successful Bone-setter.
He has passed the prime of life, being now in his seventy-seventh
year, but unfortunately he has no son to succeed
him. I might fill volumes with the recital of cases
which he has brought to a happy conclusion. Two in
particular, dreadful and hopeless to all appearance, have
placed his wonderful abilities in so positive a light before
my eyes, that I consider him at the head of his profession
as a Bone-setter, and as a rectifier of the most
alarming dislocations which are perpetually occurring
to man in his laborious journey through this disastrous
vale of tears.”</p>

<p>The published accounts of voyagers and travellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
are full of anecdotes of those who practise “bone-setting”
in different parts of the world. There is a wonderful
similarity in their modes of treatment as thus detailed.
An instance or two will suffice. Mons. C. S. Sonnini, in
his <i>Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt</i>, published, at the
beginning of this century, on his journey towards Abyssinia,
was sent for in his character as a physician to attend
the second officer in command at Miniet, who had broken
his leg three days before. He found that the leg had
been set by a Copt, whose “curious” mode of treating
the case was thought worthy of chronicling by the
traveller. “The patient,” he tells us, “was laid on the
ground without either mattress, bed, or carpet, but
merely on a bed of sand. His leg and thigh were extended
and fixed between stakes driven into the earth,
which also supported a small brick wall, raised on each
side in such a manner that the fractured limb was confined
in a piece of mason work, where it was to remain
till the completion of the cure. In order to promote the
formation of the callus of the fracture, the doctor had
made a sort of cement, oil, and the white of eggs, which
he every day applied to the leg.”</p>

<p>Friar Moulton gives a recipe of a similar kind to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
applied whilst the bone is “setting.” Cateron, in his
<i>Travels in Algeria</i>, gives a instance of the same mode of
treatment. He writes, “On our return, I called upon
the Schiek, Lisaid-Mansor, I found him stretched on a
couch built of stonework, cemented with clay, covered
only with a few rags, and with a stone for a pillow. His
leg surrounded with bandages and herbs, was firmly tied
up in and kept straight by a thick slip of bark. His
foot was immovably fixed to a stake, stuck in the ground.
He is obliged to remain in this condition until the bones
are united. This severe treatment is not unfrequently
fatal, but, if the Arab has a good constitution, and gangrene
does not set in, he recovers with a limb more or less straight.
The poor Schiek was busy flipping off with a handkerchief
tied to a stick, the swarms of flies which were
attracted to his wound. At the foot of the couch was
the Tebib or surgeon, himself reciting incantations like
his Egyptian predecessors, and prayers over the broken
limb. He appeared much put out by my entrance, for
the Arabs think that all Europeans understand medicine;
but he was re-assured when he saw I looked on without
interfering.”</p>

<p>There have been many, and are still Bone-setters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
eminence in different parts of the country, who are ready
with their welcome and useful services, when other
Denhams cry out for “a good bone-setter.” The benefits
they have conferred in the past on the sufferers by
external violence will be indicated by the testimony of
well-known public personages in the next chapter.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>In answer to the frequent questions as to what special
good Bone-setters have done in their special calling I
have thought it best to let the relieved patients of others
speak before my own. First, because they are well-known.
Their cases are indisputable, and they show
that Bone-setters understand their art. I have culled
these cases from various sources, all of which I have
acknowledged as far as possible. I have already quoted
Mr. Charles Waterton’s opinion of Bone-setters from his
“<i>Wanderings of a Naturalist</i>.” I will now direct attention
to the cure he vouches for by the Yorkshire Bone-setters:&mdash;</p>

<p>Before I close these memoranda, I have to
describe another mishap of a very dark complexion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Let me crave the reader’s leave to pen down a few
remarks on Bone-setting, practised by men called Bone-setters,
who on account of the extraordinary advance in
the art of surgery, are not now I fear, held in sufficient
estimation amongst the higher orders of society.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year 1850, I had reared
a ladder, full seven yards long, against a standard pear
tree, and I mounted nearly to the top of this ladder with
a pruning knife in hand, in order that I might correct an
overgrown luxuriance in the tree. Suddenly the ladder
swerved in a lateral direction, I adhered to it manfully,
myself and the ladder coming simultaneously to the
ground with astounding velocity. In our fall I had just
time to move my head in a direction that it did not come
in contact with the ground; still as it afterwards turned
out, there was a partial concussion of the brain; and
added to this, my whole side, from foot to shoulder, felt as
though it had been pounded in a mill. In the course of
the afternoon I took blood from my arm to the amount
of thirty ounces, and followed the affair up the next day
with a strong aperient. I believe that, with these necessary
precautions, all would have gone right again (saving
the arm) had not a second misadventure followed shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
on the heels of the first; and it was of so alarming a
nature as to induce me to take thirty ounces more of
blood by the lancet. In order to accommodate the position
of my disabled arm. I had put on a Scotch plaid in
lieu of my coat, and in it I came to my dinner. One
day the plaid having gone wrong on the shoulder, I arose
from the chair to rectify it, and the servant supposing that
I was about to retire, unluckily withdrew the chair,
unaware of this act on his part, I came backwards to the
ground with an awful shock, and this, no doubt, caused
concussion of the brain to a considerable amount.</p>

<p>Symptoms of slowly approaching dissolution now
became visible. Having settled all affairs with my
solicitor betwixt myself and the world, and with my Father
Confessor, betwixt myself and my Maker, nothing
remained but receive the final catastrophe with Christian
resignation. But though I lay insensible, with hiccups
and <i>sub sultus ten dimon</i>, for fifteen long hours, I at
last opened my eyes, and gradually arose from my
expected ruin.</p>

<p>I must now say a word or two of the externals damaged
by the fall of the ladder. Notwithstanding the best surgical
skill, my arm showed the appearance of stiff and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
withered deformity at the end of three months from the
accident. And now my general state of health was not
as it ought to be; for incessant pain prevented sleep,
whilst food itself did little good. But my slumbers were
strangely affected. I was eternally fighting wild beasts,
with a club in one hand, the other being bound up at my
breast. Nine bull-dogs attacked me one night, on the
high road, some of them having the head of a crocodile.</p>

<p>I had now serious thoughts of having the arm amputated.
This operation was fully resolved upon, when,
luckily, the advice of my trusty game-keeper, John
Ogden, rendered it unnecessary. One morning, “master,”
said he to me, “I’m sure you’re going to
the grave. You’ll die to a certainty. Let me go
for our old Bone-setter. He cured me, long ago,
and perhaps he can cure you. It was on the 25th
of March, then&mdash;alias Lady Day, which every Catholic in
the universe knows is solemn festival in the honor of the
Blessed Virgin&mdash;that I had an interview with Mr. Joseph
Crowther, the well known Bone-setter, whose family has
exercised the art from father to son time out of mind.”
On viewing my poor remnant of an arm&mdash;“Your wrist,”
said he, “is sorely injured, a callus having formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
betwixt the hand and the arm. The elbow is out of
joint and the shoulder somewhat driven forward. This
last affair will prevent your raising your arm to your
head.” Melancholy look out! “But can you cure me,
doctor?” said I. “Yes,” replied he firmly; “only let
me have my own way.” “Then take the arm, and with
it elbow, wrist and shoulder. I here deliver them up to
you; do what you please with them. Pain is no consideration
in this case, I dare say I shall have enough of
it.” “You will,” said he, emphatically. This resolute
bone-setter, whom I always compared to Chiron the
Centaur for his science and his strength, began his
operations like a man of business. In fourteen days, by
means of potent embrocations, stretching, pulling, twisting,
and jerking, he forced the shoulder and wrist to obey
him and to perform their healthy movements. The
elbow was a complicated affair. It required greater
exertions and greater attention&mdash;in fact, it was a job for
Hercules himself. Having done the needful to it (secundum
artem) for one-and-twenty days, he seemed satisfied
with the progress which he had made; and he said quite
coolly, “I’ll finish you off this afternoon.” At four
o’clock <i>post meridian</i>, his bandages, his plasters and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
wadding having been placed on the table in regular
order, he doffed his coat, tucked his shirt-sleeves above
his elbows, and said that a glass of ale would do him
good. “Then I’ll have a glass of soda water with you,”
said I, “and we’ll drink each other’s health and success
to the undertaking.”</p>

<p>The remaining act was one of unmitigated severity,
but it was absolutely necessary. My sister Eliza, foreseeing
what was to take place, felt her spirits sinking
and retired to her room. Her maid, Lucy Barnes, bold
as a little lioness, said she would see it out; whilst Mr.
Harrison, a fine young gentleman, who was on a visit to
me (and alas! is since dead in California), was ready in
case of need. The bone setter performed his part with
resolution scarcely to be contemplated, but which was
really required under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>Laying hold of the crippled arm just above the elbow
with one hand, and below with the other, he smashed to
atoms by main force the callus which had formed in the
dislocated joint, the elbow itself cracking, as if the
interior parts of it had consisted of tobacco pipe shanks.
Having predetermined in my mind not to open my
mouth, or to make any stir during the operation, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
remained passive and silent, whilst this fierce elbow contest
was raging. All being now effected as far as force
and skill were concerned, the remainder became a mere
work of time. So putting a five pound note by way of
extra fee into this sturdy operator’s hand, the binding up
of the now rectified elbow-joint was effected by him with
a nicety and a knowledge truly astonishing.</p>

<p>Health soon resumed her ancient right; sleep went
hand-in-hand with a quiet mind; life was once more
worth enjoying; and here I am just now sound as an
acorn.</p>

<p>Dr. Wharton Hood disparages the lucid statement
and style of Mr. Waterton, but does not gainsay his
testimony or facts.</p>

<p>The testimony of Mr. George Moore, the eminent
philanthropist to the skill of a “bone setter,” is duly
recorded by Dr. Smiles, in the life of the Cumberland
Worthy and London Merchant.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Mr. Moore was very
fond of hunting, both as a recreation and as a means of
health. “I hunt,” he says, “not only for pleasure, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>for my health. The exercise does me great good. I
really do not see any harm in a gallop with the hounds;
if I did I would not go out again.” He hesitates and
deliberates on the subject again and again. “I make my
health my excuse. The fresh crisp air does me good. I
am always at home when on horseback.”</p>

<p>“In March, 1867,” says Dr. Smiles (pp. 292), “he
met with an accident which put a stop to his hunting.”
The meet was at Torpendow. From thence they went to
the top of Binsey, a heathery fell, to the south of Whitehall.
There they found a fox, and viewed him away.
Always anxious to keep up with the hounds, Mr. Moore
rode fast down the hill. But his bay mare got her foot
in a rabbit hole, and the rider got a regular cropper.
He found that his shoulder was stiff. Nevertheless, he
mounted again and galloped away. The hounds were in
full cry. He kept up pretty well, though his shoulder
was severely hurt.</p>

<p>Next day he entertained a dozen friends, amongst
whom was the master of the hunt and Frank Buckland.
Nothing was talked about but fox-hunting. “I think,”
says Mr. Moore, “I must make yesterday my last day’s
hunting.” Shortly after he consulted a celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
surgeon, at Carlisle, about his shoulder. The joint was
found “all right,” though the muscles were pronounced
strained and hurt. Nothing could be done for the pain
but to grin and hide it.</p>

<p>He went to the Castle Compensation Meeting, at Carlisle,
in which he took an active part. Then he went to
sit on the bench at Wigton, for he was a Justice of the
Peace for Cumberland. After that he had twenty friends
and relatives to tea and supper. “I hope,” he says,
“that I shall never forget my poor relations and
friends.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the intense pain in his shoulder, Mr.
Moore continued to hunt. The year after his shoulder
had been dislocated, he invited the Cumberland Hunt to
meet at Whitehall. About sixty horsemen were present.
They breakfasted in the old hall and then proceeded to
mount. Mr. Moore was in low spirits because of the
pain in his shoulder, and at first he did not intend to
join his friends. But Geering, his coachman, urged him
to go, and Sir Wilfred Lawson joined him in his persuasions.
At length Mr. Moore’s favorite horse, Zouave
was brought out, and with his arm in a sling and a cigar
in his mouth he consented to mount. Mrs. Moore and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Lady Lawson ascended the tower and saw the brilliant
red coats ride away through the park.</p>

<p>The array of horsemen passed on to Watch-hill and
found a fox. He was viewed away, and went across
Whitehall-park, close under the wall of the west-front
garden, followed by the hounds and riders. It was a
sight not often to be seen. The day was splendid,
although it was in November. The sun was shining
and the red coats, jumping hedges and fences amidst
green fields, brightened up the picture. The fox went up
the hill, out of sight of the gazers from the tower, and
was lost in Parkhouse covers. Again the hunt proceeded
to Watch Hill and found another fox. Away it went
almost in the same direction, passing through Whitehall
Park with the hounds and hunters at its heels. There
was a slight check at Park-wood. Then it took straight
away for Binsey, went up the side of the hill, and passed
on to Snittlegarth, and was lost at Bewaldeth.</p>

<p>It grew dark. No more could be done that night.
No fox had been killed, though the hunters had got a
splendid run. Mr. Moore returned home with his arm
in his sling, though nothing the worse for his day’s
exercise. “It was,” he says, “a very enjoyable day. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
do like a day’s hunting. I always feel more light and
buoyant after it.” It was his last hunt.</p>

<p>The various surgeons to whom Mr. Moore applied did
not give him any relief from the pain he suffered in consequence
of this accident. He bore it throughout the
year, 1868, during the time he was Prime-Warden of the
Fishmongers’ Company.</p>

<p>Dr. Smiles says (pp. 318, 319)&mdash;“He had consulted
the most eminent surgeons. They could find no cure
for the pain in his shoulder. Some called it rheumatism,
others neuralgia, some recommended a six months’ sea
voyage, others strapped up his shoulder with plasters and
told him to keep his arm in a sling. At length the pain
became unbearable. Sometimes the shoulder grew very
black. The dislocation forward, which it seems to have
been, interrupted the circulation of the blood. Still he
continued to work on as before.”</p>

<p>On the 7th December, 1868, he writes with difficulty
in his diary&mdash;“I was struck down with neuralgia at the
Middlesex Hospital, when on a committee for selecting
a clergyman. I had my shoulder cut open to insert
morphia. I am <i>very</i> bad!”</p>

<p>He was taken home in a cab by the late Mr. De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Morgan (surgeon). When he entered the house he clung
by a pillar as if he were drunk. He could scarcely get
up to his bedroom, and there he dozed and rambled; but
the pain was somewhat relieved. He called in one of the
most eminent surgeons in London, but, as Mr. Moore
writes&mdash;“he did not understand my shoulder.” Another
surgeon was called in&mdash;and still another, but the result
was the same. It was with great difficulty he could
attend the consecration of his church in Somers’ Town,
with his arm in a sling. “The shoulder,” he says, “is
not so black as formerly, but the pain is more acute.”
Then the first physician in London was called in.&mdash;“It is
a most painful affection of the shoulder-joint.” The
patient already knew that. But the physicians as well
as the surgeons could do nothing for him.</p>

<p>He went about, though looking very ill, to the Field
Lane Refuge&mdash;to the Industrial Dwellings&mdash;to Christ’s
Hospital&mdash;to the Court of the Fishmongers. He even
travelled down to York to stay a few days with the Archbishop.
On his return he attended a meeting of Christ’s
Hospital, “about a reform in the mode of education
in the school.” A few days later he says, “The neuralgia
came on fearfully all day, and at night I was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
torture. Mrs. Moore rushed off in the brougham to
fetch Dr.&mdash;&mdash;, that he might see my arm at the
blackest. Still nothing could be done. Then Mr.&mdash;&mdash;
came and plastered and bandaged up my arm.” The
patient could not write; it was with difficulty that he
could sign a cheque. His wife then became his amanuensis.
At a banquet at the Fishmongers’, he was seized
with one of his furious paroxysms of neuralgia. A surgeon
was sent for, who came and gave him chloroform.</p>

<p>At length he could bear his pain no longer. He had
been advised to go to a well-known bone-setter. No!
He would not do that. He had put himself in the hands
of the first surgeons of the day. Why should he go to
an irregular practitioner? At length, however, he was
persuaded by his friends. As the surgeons had done
their best, why should he not try the bone-setter? He
called upon Mr. Hutton, at his house. He looked at the
shoulder. Well, he would try and put it in. This was
new comfort. Mr. Hutton recommended his patient to
buy some neat’s-foot oil and rub it in as hot as he could
bear it. “Where can we buy the stuff?” asked Mrs.
Moore. “You can take a soda-water bottle and get it
at a tripe shop in Tottenham Court Road.” “We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
not got a soda-water bottle with us.” “You can get
one at the corner at the public-house!&mdash;you might get it
at a druggist’s,” he continued, “but he will charge you
three times as dear.” The neat’s-foot oil was at last got;
the shoulder was duly rubbed with it; and the bone-setter
arrived at Kensington Palace Gardens to do his
best or his worst. He made Mr. Moore sign a paper
before he proceeded with his operation, in which he
agreed to be satisfied whether failure or success was
the result. Hutton took the arm in his hand, gave it
two or three turns, and then gave it a tremendous twist
round in the socket. The shoulder-joint was got in!
George Moore threw his arm out with strength straight,
before him, and said, “I could fight,” whereas, a
moment before he could not raise it two inches. It had
been out for nearly two years.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore was taken to task by his professional friends
for going to a quack about his shoulder. “Well,” said
he, “quack or no quack, he cured me, and that was all I
wanted. Whereas, I was blind, now I see.” After presenting
a bust of Lord Brougham and a silver claret jug
to the Fishmongers’, in memory of his prime wardenship,
he set out for Whitehall on the following day and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
invited Mr. Hutton (the bone-setter) to join him in
Cumberland, as a token of his thanks to him for having
relieved his sufferings. The shoulder continued to
improve. When his benefactor Hutton, the bone-setter,
arrived at Whitehall, he gave him a hearty welcome, and
sent him away rejoicing. Mr. Moore was no more
troubled with his shoulder.</p>

<p>Hutton died soon afterwards, and Mr. Moore remarks
in his diary that he was as much struck by his unworldliness
as by his skill, for he refused to take any fee additional
to the £5 that was at first asked. It was with
great pressure that Mr. Moore prevailed upon him to
take £5 more.</p>

<p>During his repeated accessions of pain he entered, or
made Mrs. Moore enter, many memoranda in his diary, of
which we subjoin a few:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We must wait until the day dawns, and the shadows
flee away, to know how wise and suitable every dealing
of God is with us.”</p>

<p>“I am ashamed to think that I sometimes doubt
whether God hears my prayers&mdash;they are so poor, so
weak, so spiritless. I thank God my faith is as simple as
a child’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>“I have sorrows to go through, but they will only
prove joy afterwards. Whom our Master loveth He
chasteneth. No Cross no Crown. As I suffer so I shall
enjoy. Prayer is the mightiest influence men can use.
Like the dew in summer, it makes no noise. It is
unseen, but produces immense results.”</p>

<p>“Exercise is the secret of a healthy body, and active
working for God is the secret of a healthy soul. He that
watereth other shall be watered himself.”</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> case related by Dr. Smiles is interesting to every
Bone-setter, as well as to the public at large, for it drew
attention to the fact that there existed a number of
“specialists” who had made bone-setting and sprains
their study, who had inherited the experience of their
predecessors, and who, though not recognised by the
“schools,” or enrolled under the various acts for the
registration of medical practitioners, had done a vast
amount of good and had alleviated a great deal of pain
which had baffled the <i>skill</i> of the regular surgeons.</p>

<p>Dr. William Chambers, in the <i>Journal</i> which bears his
name, had drawn attention to the case of Mr. George
Moore, in a review of Dr. Smiles’ book, which seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
have excited the indignation of several surgeons, who
“called in question the accuracy of the story.” To
these the editor, presumably Dr. Chambers himself,
replies by quoting the testimony of a number of correspondents
who had favoured him with their experiences.
Dr. Chambers refers those who doubt the statement about
Mr. George Moore, to Dr. Smiles himself, whom he truly
says “is not given to romancing.” “We have,” he
continues,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> “ourselves, however, known some curious
instances of illiterate men who, by a sort of natural tact,
were eminently successful as bone-setters.” One of these
instances was that of a drummer in a militia regiment as
long ago as 1812, who, when discharged at the peace of
1815, set up as a bone-setter, and made a living by his
profession. Not long since, there died an eminent bone-setter
on Spey-side, to whom persons suffering from dislocations
flocked from all quarters. It seems ridiculous
to pooh-pooh instances of this kind. A wiser policy
would consist in finding out what were the special modes
of operation of these bone-setters, and taking a hint from
them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>
<p>While one correspondent has favoured us with his
doubts on the subject of unprofessional bone-setting,
others have written to verify cases such as that recorded
by George Moore’s biographer. One of these communications
is as follows: ‘In 1865, I had met with a severe
accident on board a ship coming home from India, and
among other injuries the middle finger of my right hand
was much injured. There were two or three doctors
among the passengers besides the ship’s surgeon, and
they all agreed that it was merely a severe bruise. I
thought little of it, hoping it would soon get right; but
when six weeks had passed and the finger was still quite
powerless, I consulted an excellent general practitioner
in England, who said the joint was enlarged, and recommended
an application of iodine, which took off the skin,
but had no other effect. Two other surgeons&mdash;one of
them a man of considerable repute&mdash;were consulted, but
with no better result; and eventually I was persuaded to
go to a bone-setter in Liverpool. The moment he felt
the finger he said “It’s dislocated.” The treatment was
very simple. The finger was enveloped in a bag of bran
and kept constantly wet for a fortnight, and then it was
set. The operator gave it a violent wrench. I heard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
crack like that made when one pulls one’s finger-joints
sharply; and from that moment I had the full use of my
finger, which until then was absolutely powerless. The
fee, as far as I remember, was ten shillings, certainly not
more.</p>

<p>“The case which led me to consult this bone-setter
was much more remarkable. Among the passengers on
board the same ship was an Indian civilian who had been
severely mauled by a tiger, in trying to save a fellow-sportsman’s
life, and had quite lost the use of one arm.
He was on his way home to see if anything could be
done to restore it; and his disappointment was great
when, after some months’ treatment by one of the greatest
of London surgeons, there was hardly any improvement,
and no hope was held out of more than a very partial
cure. While down in Wales, he heard of the bone-setter
above mentioned, who was a native of the Principality,
and determined to try his powers. In a few months, by
simple treatment and the wonderful power of manipulation
which this man possessed, the use of the arm was
entirely restored, and has ever since remained so.”’</p>

<p>The gentleman above alluded to was undoubtedly
Mr. Evan Thomas, of Crosshall Street, Liverpool, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
reputation and skill enabled him to realise a handsome
competence. The record of his cures, and the instances
in which he has given relief when regular surgeons have
failed, would fill a volume. A well-known actor on the
London stage has furnished several instances which fell
under his personal knowledge. Mr. Evan Thomas is
now represented by a relative (a son I believe) who has
taken out a diploma as a surgeon, and is therefore a
“bone-setter” according to Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>The writer of the above anecdotes expressly points out
that he does not for a moment wish to disparage the
skill and care shewn by the regularly qualified surgeons
in ordinary and in many extraordinary cases. They are
with few exceptions, upright and generous men, and
their kindness and tenderness seem specially developed
by the pain which they so often have to inflict; but there
are cases&mdash;more frequent, I believe, than is commonly
supposed&mdash;where something more than training and
practise is needed; and there are a few men (and women
too) who seem intuitively to possess this something&mdash;a
gift of touch which tells them when a joint, or it may be
a muscle or tendon, is not in its right place, and enables
them to put it right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>“It is this which I think the medical profession and
the public generally should recognise, instead of speaking
of these bone-setters, as is often done, as quacks, and
their cures as fables, or at best happy accidents. In some
cases the possessors of this gift have taken the necessary
diploma which permits them to practise; in others they
have not the means or education which would enable
them to do so; or perhaps they have only discovered
their gift comparatively late in life, when they have
settled down to other professions.” “Surely,” the Editor
remarks, “some means could be devised by which this
gift, when it is discovered in an individual, can be
utilised for the benefit of suffering humanity without the
ordinary diploma, and yet with some check which would
prevent imposture. The first step is the recognition that
such a gift does exist; and then let it be the subject of
intelligent inquiry.”</p>

<p>The next instance given in the <i>Journal</i> before referred
(pp. 712) is contributed by a well-known clergyman of
Northamptonshire, and is a voluntary and unlooked for
testimonial to the author. He writes as follows:&mdash;“Some
twelve years since, when returning from a visit
to a friend on a bitterly cold December evening, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
unluckily slipped upon a sheet of ice on the foot-path,
and fell with my leg bent completely under me. The
pain was intense, and for a quarter of an hour I was
unable to raise myself up. Fortunately, I was not far
from home, and managed to crawl to my own door. For
two or three subsequent days I endured excruciating
agony, and consulted my usual medical men in the town
of &mdash;&mdash;, who pronounced my injury to be a violent
sprain of the muscles of the knee, and after tightly
bandaging the joint, they recommended entire rest for
some days. For six weeks I hardly moved out-of-doors,
and was quite unable, without assistance, to put on my
stockings and boots.</p>

<p>“One day a neighbour suggested my seeing a celebrated
bone-setter who pays a weekly visit to this neighbourhood.
I eagerly adopted the suggestion, and by the aid
of two sticks, attended by a friend, I contrived to get
into and out of the train, and reached the bone-setter’s
residence in due course. He first directed me to undress,
and placed a chair to rest my leg upon. After manipulating
the limb, he pressed my leg with such force that I
fainted away, and when I recovered my senses, the perspiration
was literally streaming down my face. I asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
for some brandy, which he produced out of a cupboard
close by, remarking: ‘I always keep my physic here.’</p>

<p>“For some ten minutes afterwards I felt very faint and
in great pain; and without noticing his movements, he
again suddenly pressed my leg, causing me to faint away
a second time; and when I came to, I found my friend at
my side whom I had left up-stairs, and who, startled by
my screams, had hastened down to see what was the
matter.</p>

<p>“The bone-setter then said: “Get up and walk;
your knee was dislocated, but you are now all right.”
To my inexpressible joy I found my knee replaced, and
was able to walk as well as ever, and which for six weeks
I had been unable to do without the assistance of two
sticks. For ten years my leg was so well and strong,
that I never needed the services of the bone-setter.
Unfortunately, about two years since, in pulling off my
boot I again dislocated the same knee, but in moving
suddenly in my chair to reach a book, the joint returned
into the socket, like the sharp report of a pistol. It has
once since been out, but I have managed to replace the
joint myself; but I occasionally go to the bone-setter to
have the limb tightly plastered and bandaged, and over
the bandage I always wear an elastic knee-cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>“A neighbour of mine had a bad fall out hunting about
two years ago, and injured his shoulder, and for
several weeks was unable to raise his arm, and like
myself, put himself under the charge of his usual medical
attendant. As the injury did not seem to abate, I
advised him to go to this same bone-setter, which he did,
and in a very short period he quite recovered the use of
the limb, and is now able to drive and ride as well as
ever; the remedy he was ordered to adopt was hard
friction, night and morning, with rum and neat’s-foot
oil.</p>

<p>“I will mention an anecdote told me by this bone-setter.
A poor servant-girl who had been an in-patient
of a neighbouring infirmary for seventeen weeks, and
had been discharged as incurable, consulted the bone-setter,
who discovered her ankle to be dislocated. With
a violent twist he replaced it, and she gladly left behind
her, in his house, the two crutches she had used for
upwards of four months!</p>

<p>“Although it seems almost incredible that regularly
qualified surgeons do not understand the art of bone-setting,
or adopt their somewhat rough usage, I believe
they really dare not do so for fear of being accused of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
rude treatment, by ladies or persons of sensitive feelings.
I believe the knack of bone-setting to be hereditary; at
any rate it is so in the case of my bone-setter (which is
literally true), who is of the third generation in this
style of treatment.”</p>

<p>The following is a case related by Dr. Wharton Hood,
in his work on “Bone-setting:”&mdash;</p>

<p>“A gentleman, whom I will call Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;, when
sitting on a stool at his office, hastily descended it to
welcome a friend. As soon as his feet reached the
ground he turned his body without moving them, and
in so doing he twisted or wrenched his left knee. He
immediately felt considerable pain in the joint, which
lasted for an hour or two, but decreased as the day wore
on, and he continued to move about as occasion required.
In the night he was aroused by increased pain, and
found the joint much swollen. Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; was the
brother of the professor of midwifery at one of the
principal medical schools in London, and he had the best
surgical advice that London could afford. He was
ordered to rest the limb and to apply heat and moisture.
In this way he obtained some diminution of the pain,
but the swelling continued. He at last sent for Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Hutton, who at once declared that the knee was “out,”
and proposed to replace it. An appointment for this
purpose was made, but in the meantime the patient had
again seen eminent surgeons, and he wrote to prevent
Mr. Hutton from coming. Two years of uninterrupted
surgical treatment passed without improvement, and
then Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; sent for Mr. Hutton again. On this
the second visit I accompanied him, and what I witnessed,”
says Dr. Hood, “made a great impression on
my mind. We found the knee-joint enveloped in strapping;
and when this was removed, the joint was seen to
be much swollen, the skin shining and discoloured. The
joint was immovable, and very painful on the inner side.
Mr. Hutton at once placed his thumb on a point over
the lower edge of the inner condyle of the femur, and
the patient shrank from the pressure and complained of
great pain. He (Mr. Hutton) made no further examination
of the limb, but said: “What did I tell you two
years ago?” Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; replied: “You said my knee
was out.” “And I tell you so now,” was the rejoinder.
“Can you put it in?” said Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;. “I can.” ‘Then
be good enough to do so,’ said Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;, holding out
his limb. Mr. Hutton. however, declined to operate for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
a week; ordered the joint to be enveloped in linseed
poultices and rubbed with neat’s-foot oil, made an
appointment, and took his leave. During the dialogue
I had carefully examined the limb, and satisfied myself
that there was no dislocation, and had arrived at the
conclusion that rest, and not movement, was the treatment
required. At the expiration of the week I went
again to the house, and Mr. Hutton arrived shortly
afterwards. “How’s the knee?” was his inquiry. “It
feels easier.” “Been able to move it?” “No.” “Give
it to me.” The leg was stretched out, and Mr. Hutton
stood in front of the patient, who hesitated, and lowered
his limb. “You are quite sure it is out, and you can
put it right?” There was a pause, and then: “Give
me your leg, I say.” The patient obeyed reluctantly,
and slowly raised it to within Mr. Hutton’s reach. He
grasped it with both hands, round the calf, with the
extended thumb of the left hand pressing on the painful
spot on the inner side of the knee, and held the foot
firmly by grasping the heel between his own knees. The
patient was told to sit steadily in his chair, and at that
moment I think he would have given a good deal to have
regained control over his limb. Mr. Hutton inclined his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
knees towards his right, thus aiding in the movement of
rotation which he impressed upon the leg with his hands.
He maintained firm pressure with his thumb on the
painful spot, and suddenly flexed the knee. The patient
cried out with pain. Mr. Hutton lowered the limb, and
told him to stand up. He did so, and at once declared
he could move the leg better, and that the previously
painful spot was free from pain. He was ordered to take
gentle daily exercise, and his recovery was rapid and
complete. In a few days he returned to business, and
from that time until his death, which occurred three
years afterwards, his knee remained perfectly well.”</p>

<p>Another case was that of the Honourable Spencer
Ponsonby, who is suffered to tell his own story. “On
November 26th, 1864, in running across the garden at
Croxteth, near Liverpool, I felt and heard something crack
in the calf of my left leg. It was so painful that I
rolled over like a shot rabbit, and could scarcely reach
the house, a few yards off. I at once put my leg up to
the knee in a pail of hot water, and boiled it for an hour.
Next day, being no better, I sent for a medical man in
the neighbourhood, who told me I had snapped a muscle,
and must keep quiet for a few days. He rubbed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
strong liniment, there being no sign of inflammation;
and put on a strong leather plaster. In a couple of days
I was able to hobble; but being telegraphed to London,
and going into an empty house, I knocked my toe against
a tack in the floor, and hurt myself worse than ever.
From this time (December 2nd) to the beginning of
May, I was attended by Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; in
consultation, who agreed in saying that the “stocking of
the calf was split” (gastrocnemius, I think they called it)
and treated me accordingly. Occasionally my leg got
better; but the slightest exertion produced pain and
weakness.</p>

<p>“On the 2nd of May, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; undertook me. He
agreed as to the injury, but thought that, constitutionally,
I was out of order, and gave me some iron, &amp;c., without
effect. My leg was also fixed in an iron machine to
relieve the muscles of the calf from the weight of the
leg. Another eminent surgeon came in consultation on
June 26. He agreed in Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;’s treatment, and in
the cause of the lameness; as did Dr. D&mdash;&mdash;, who was
consulted as to my going to Wildbad.</p>

<p>“<i>August 14.</i>&mdash;As I did not improve, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; put
my leg into a gum-plaster for a month. I then went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
yachting, so as to obtain perfect repose for that time.
My health, which had been getting bad, was improved
by the sea-air, but my leg was no better. The surgeon
on board the yacht, Dr. E&mdash;&mdash;, also examined me, and
agreed as to the cause of the lameness, but said: ‘An
old woman may cure you, but no doctor will.’</p>

<p>“On September 7 the gum-plaster was removed, and
galvanism was then tried for about three weeks. At the
end of this time I went on a yacht voyage for four
months, and, during the whole of this period had sea-water
douches. All this time I had been either on
crutches or two sticks. My health was much improved
by the sea-voyage, but my leg was the same as before,
and had shrunk to about half its proper size.</p>

<p>“<i>April 5.</i>&mdash;Mr. F&mdash;&mdash; began his system to cure my
leg. His idea was, that the muscles were separated, but
that if brought together continuously, they would rejoin.
I wore a high-heeled boot during the day, and during the
night my heel was fixed so that it was kept in the same
position. No good arose from this treatment; and consequently,
after a month’s trial, I went to Mr. Hutton,
who, on seeing my high heel, said: ‘What do you wear
that machine for? Do you want to lame yourself?’ I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
was proceeding to tell him the opinion of the various
surgeons on my case, when he said: ‘Don’t bother me
about anatomy; I know nothing about it; but I tell
you your ankle is out, and that I can put it in again.’</p>

<p>“After a few weeks, during which he had been to the
the North, and could not therefore undertake my case,
I returned to him on June 27, telling him that I had in
the meantime consulted surgeons who had assured me
that, whatever else might ail me, my ankle was most
assuredly ‘all right,’ but that I would notwithstanding
submit to his treatment. He again examined me most
carefully, beginning at the ankle round bone, and he
then put his thumb on to a place which hurt me a good
deal, and produced a sensation of a sharp prick of a pin.
He proceeded to operate upon me, and after a time there
was a distinct report, and from that moment the pain
was gone. Mr. Hutton desired me to walk moderately,
but to take no violent exercise for a long time, and to
use a good deal of cold water. From that moment my
leg gradually got better. I was able to walk out shooting
quietly in September, and on the 14th October,
having missed a train, walked home fifteen miles along
the high-road. In the following year I resumed cricket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
tennis, and other strong exercise, and have continued
them ever since.</p>

<p>In page 103 to 109 of his work before quoted, Dr.
W. Hood relates the experience of his father in treating
of sprained ankles, in a manner similar to that practised
by the bone-setter, and illustrates the system by these
two typical cases, which, though by no means extraordinary
in their treatment and cure, have been thought
worthy of publication by him. Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; sprained his
left ankle eighteen weeks before coming under treatment.
For the first month he laid on a sofa; at the end of that
time he was able to get about on crutches, and when he
presented himself for treatment was compelled to use a
couple of sticks. At no time since the injury had he
been able to walk farther than two or three hundred
yards without resting. He complained of pain on the
inner side of the foot, and stiffness and pain in the great
toe when he attempted to use his foot. He was operated
upon for the purpose of replacing the bone of the foot,
and overcoming the stiffness of the toe. He returned
home by rail the same day, and, on alighting at the
station walked half-a-mile slowly to his house. His
powers of locomotion steadily improved, and four days
after the operation he walked three miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. G&mdash;&mdash; came to Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; on the recommendation
of Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; and also was induced to do so from
the benefit he saw that Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; had derived from the
treatment. In this case the ankle had been sprained
and bruised by a horse falling on him a year-and-a-half
previous to his visit to Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;. Owing to the road
along which he was riding having been much cut up by
cart wheels, his injury was much more severe than would
usually occur from this form of accident. When the
horse fell he was not thrown but went down with it; the
injured foot touched the ground, sinking into one of the
ruts, when before he could withdraw it, the animal
rolled over, wrenching and bruising the limb most fearfully.
The foot was seen by Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, was still much
swollen, and very stiff in all parts. He was considered
to have “five bones out” and the usual manipulations
were employed for their reduction. It required three
operations, at intervals of a week, before the stiffness of
the foot was removed, but at the end of three weeks he
walked as well as he ever did in his life. When he came
he had his foot in a sling suspended from his neck, so
utterly useless was the limb.</p>

<p>The advantage of the employment of movement a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
days after the receipt of the injury is shown, he says, by the
history of one of the cases that he saw with Mr. Hutton:</p>

<p>J. F. (Stanmore) was thrown from a cart by the horse
stumbling when going down hill. He fell on his right
shoulder and side of his head. He remained stunned
for about an hour; on coming to himself and trying to
raise with the assistance of the right arm, he found himself
unable to raise it, much less to bear any weight upon
it. He succeeded with great difficulty in getting
into his cart (the horse it appears did not fall completely
and waited quietly at the side of the road) and driving
home. He suffered great pain all night, the arm being
perfectly useless, and the parts about the shoulder much
swollen. He saw Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; the following day and was
directed by him to poultice and use neat’s foot oil for a
week. At the end of the week he was operated upon.
Increased pain followed the operation; it was not, however,
in the same spot, having shifted from the shoulder
to the outer side of the arm, near the insertion of the
deltoid. No improvement in power of movement
occurred at the time; he could not raise his hand to his
head or bend his forearm. On his next visit, three days
afterwards, he said that the pain continued through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
night, that he dropped off to sleep towards morning, and
when he awoke he found that it had materially abated,
and his sufferings had been comparatively slight since.
The swelling had diminished, but the motions of the
joint were not much freer.</p>

<p>At the expiration of a week from the time of the
operation, he appeared again; and he could then place
his hand behind his head and also on the opposite
shoulder. “With the exception of a slight stiffness, he
considered his limb quite well.”</p>

<p>Yet two other cases from the same source:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. J&mdash;&mdash;, on rising from her chair one day in 1864
caught her heel in her crinoline, and fell backwards upon
her sacrum. She did not feel much pain from the fall at
the moment although she felt a good deal shaken. At
this period she had been six weeks pregnant. On the
fifth day from the date of the accident, having in the
meantime, without any definite cause of complaint, been
“out of sorts,” she noticed a feeling of stiffness and
numbness extending over the whole of the body, but
more especially in the extremities. Shortly after this
occurred she was seized with convulsions of an epileptiform
character. These convulsions they recurred at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
varying intervals of sometimes three or four days, and at
other times of ten days or a fortnight, until her confinement.
After this event she was subject to them, but at
longer intervals until October, 1869. Their increased
frequency about this time induced her to consult Mr.
Hutton, both she and her friends considering that, as she
had never had any affection of this description previous
to her fall, the blow on her back might fairly be looked
upon as the cause of her trouble. A very tender spot
was complained of at the junction of the last lumbar
vertebra with the sacrum. The sensations which preceded
the commencement of the fit were referred to
that spot and the opinion given by Mr. Hutton was that
a bone was “out” there. On the three or four days preceding
his visit she had many severe convulsions; she
was suffering from exhaustion consequent upon them and
fully expected to be obliged to remain in bed some days
to recover herself. She describes herself as suffering at
the same time from head-ache and fullness; her back was
very painful; she was flushed in the face, very depressed
in spirits, her eyesight was dim and she was very faint.</p>

<p>When operated upon in the manner, hereafter to be
described, she felt “a sudden feeling of numbness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
brain,” this feeling travelling upwards from the spot
where the pressure was applied, and then immediately
following this a sensation which made her say “I am all
right.” In a minute or two she got into bed without
assistance, lay down on her left side&mdash;a position she had
not been able to take before&mdash;her color became natural,
her head felt as if a weight had been removed from it,
the dimness of sight disappeared, and a difficulty of raising
the lids previously had gone. She remained in bed
two hours, and then was able to be dressed and go down
stairs. She had no return of the fits and had been quite
free from them up to October, 1870.</p>

<p>The other case mentioned by Dr. Hood is given in
the words of the patient, who states&mdash;</p>

<p>“In July, 1859, I was playing in the garden with my
children, when one of them tossed a large indiarubber
ball into the adjoining garden, which was separated from
my own by a stone wall about six feet high. I procured
a pair of steps and got over the wall; and coming back
I sat for a few minutes on the top of the wall, and then
jumped down, alighting upon the gravel walk. I felt no
ill effects from the jump at that time, but, awaking early
nest morning I found my left leg very stiff, and sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>posing
this would pass off I went to business as usual;
but on walking I experienced pain on the inside of the
knee joint, which increased during the day, and at night
I could scarcely walk.</p>

<p>“The next morning I sent for my medical man (Mr.
A&mdash;&mdash;) who after examining the knee pronounced the
injury to be external to the joint, and I think he said
some cartilage had been strained. He ordered me to
pump cold water on it, which I did for several days; but
the pain increased and the knee began to swell. Mr.
A&mdash;&mdash; then ordered leeches to be applied, and afterwards
a large blister enveloping the knee.</p>

<p>After this the leg became very rigid at the joint, and
flexed so that the heel would not touch the ground, and
I could only move from one room to another by the help
of crutches. After about two months’ confinement to the
house my appetite failed and I became very unwell. I
then saw another surgeon (Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;) who thought that
there was something forming in the joint, but that my
general health was failing, and that I ought to have
change of air, so by his and Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;’s advice I went
to the sea-side where I remained until November.</p>

<p>“Whilst there I applied sea-weed poultices, and bathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
my knee in warm sea water; but was soon obliged to
discontinue this treatment as it greatly irritated the joint,
which became so tender and painful that I could not bear
the weight of the sheet upon it as I lay in bed. The
flesh of my thigh began to waste away at this time, and
I lost power in my left arm, thumb, and forefinger;
so that for some time I was unable to use a fork at meals.
I called in a local practitioner (Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;) who gave me
medicine; but as he said the pain in the knee was of
secondary importance, he did not prescribe for it. I took
exercise occasionally in an invalid chair, but, owing to
the difficulty of getting down stairs and the vibration of
the chair itself, this did me more harm than good.</p>

<p>“I returned home in November, and passed the winter
with very little improvement; and having purchased a
very easy invalid carriage with shafts for a donkey, went
out when the weather permitted.</p>

<p>I continued to apply iodine and kept wet cloths constantly
upon the limb to keep down inflammation, and
this treatment succeeded in a measure, but only so long
as I kept the leg at rest; for on making the smallest
attempt to use it the inflammation returned.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1860 it was thought advisable I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
should consult Sir B. Brodie, and my medical man (Mr.
A&mdash;&mdash;) went with me to London; but finding that Sir
Benjamin was out of town he took me to Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;,
who affected to treat the matter very lightly, and said
that I was to take a tonic, which he prescribed, and that
as my health improved my knee would get well. He also
sent me to a surgical bandage maker, who measured me
for a knee cap which was to enable me to walk and take
more exercise than I had hitherto done.</p>

<p>This knee cap I was however unable to wear, until
some months later, when, the inflammation having subsided,
I found it gave me some support; but I was never
able to wear it without much discomfort. Up to October
1865 (a period of six years and a quarter) I used
crutches&mdash;sometimes two, at other times one crutch and
a stout stick and was never at ease, the knee always stone
cold when in bed or otherwise resting, and hot after
exertion of any kind&mdash;the pain becoming acute whenever
I attempted to use the limb beyond just crossing the
room. During this period (six years) I spent a portion
of every summer at the seaside, and was withdrawn
almost entirely from business. At length after so long a
course of treatment, I ceased to seek further advice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
believing what I was told, that the cause of all my
suffering was constitutional, and I settled down to the
conclusion that I should be a cripple for life and that
this was unavoidable.</p>

<p>“In June, 1865, I was recommended by a friend to
consult Mr. Hutton, but when I had learned he was an
irregular practitioner, I declined; and it was not until
October, when, owing to an accidental stumble against
the door-sill, I was in much pain again, that I acceded
to the earnest solicitations of my friends. I then wrote
to him and made an appointment. At the first interview
he came to me in the waiting-room and, looking me hard
in the face, he said, ‘who sent you here?’ I told him
who it was that recommended me to him. He said,
‘Do you know that I am not a regular surgeon?’ I
answered, ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, then, what’s the matter with
you?’ I told him I was lame. ‘Are those your
sticks?’ pointing to the crutches. ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, let
me look at your leg.’ He then instantly placed his
thumb on the tender spot inside the knee, causing me
great pain. I said, ‘Yes, that is the place, and no other.’
‘Ah!’ he replied, ‘I thought so. That will do. How
long have you been lame?’ ‘Six years.’ ‘What treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>ment
have you had?’ I told him, and also that my
lameness resulted from constitutional causes. He said,
‘Bah! If you had not had a pretty good constitution
they would have killed you.’ I told him that I had
seen Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘You might as well
have seen my cook. He can’t cure that knee.’ I asked
him what he thought was the matter with it. He said,
‘That knee is out; I’ll stake my reputation upon it, and
I can cure it.’ I was ordered to apply linseed meal
poultices for a week, and then go to him again, and
happily with the best results. I have never needed the
use of crutches since, and although it was some time
before I gained much strength in the leg, I am now able
to walk as well as before the injury. I forgot to
mention that before leaving Mr. Hutton’s house I
walked up a flight of stairs and down again, a feat I had
not accomplished for years.”</p>

<p>As a contribution to the patient’s point of view, and
as a pendant to some remarks made in the course of the
preceding pages, Dr. Hood thought it desirable to print
a portion of the letter that accompanied the narrative:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">
“<i>May, 1871.</i><span class="h">xxxx</span>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In my communication I have confined
myself to a relation of facts only, abstaining from all comment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
but I should now like to say that I think you are doing great
service to the public in bringing the subject of (so-called) bone-setting
prominently before the profession, so as to induce them
to give it a measure of attention, instead of pooh-poohing it, as
has been their almost invariable practice hitherto. In my own
case, after submitting to Mr. Hutton’s manipulation, I was
instantly relieved from that pain, tension, and coldness in the
joint that I had suffered for six years, and was able to walk.
This recovery, which to myself and friends seemed little short
of a miracle, was thus accounted for by the faculty:&mdash;Mr.
A&mdash;&mdash; (whose patient I had been) on the subject being mentioned
to him, laughed, and said, with a significant shrug, ‘Yes,
yes! a nervous knee! we all know what nervous knees are!
ay! ay!’ Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, who, as a friend, had seen my knee frequently
(though not professionally) assured all who mentioned
the case to him that I might have walked twelve months earlier
had I cared to do so. Other medical men accounted for the
manifest change in my condition on one hypothesis and another,
whilst all affected to smile at my ignorance and delusion.</p>

<p>“Thus much as to the profession, but what were my own
thoughts and those of my friends and the public generally? I
was like the man spoken of in the Gospels, who had been blind,
and now could see I had been lame and in pain, but could now
walk and was at ease. I cared nothing for professional sneers as
to nervous or not nervous; and had the whole College of Surgeons
clearly demonstrated to their entire satisfaction that I
could not possibly have been benefitted by Mr. Hutton’s treatment,
my opinion would not have been shaken by it.</p>

<p>“Then as to the public: my case having been well known
my recovery was quickly noised abroad, and a number of people
in the neighbourhood who had suffered many things of many
physicians and were nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
sought Mr. Hutton’s advice, and were cured; and this has hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>pened
in so many instances that public confidence in the ability
of the regular practitioner to deal with this class of cases has
been greatly shaken. I cannot better illustrate this than by
relating the following case:&mdash;</p>

<p>“One Thursday morning last autumn a man came to me, and,
on my inquiring his business, he told me he wanted my advice.
He was a laborer in a factory who in lifting a weight, had
twisted his knee which was much swollen and painful when he
walked. I asked him what advice he had had. He said he had
been under the doctors’ hands some time, but the leg was worse
and he was now ordered to lay up entirely for a month, and was
assured that unless he did so he would lose his leg. In one hand
he held a medical certificate to entitle him (being unable to
work) to go on his club; in the other he had a large lump of
dark paste, about the size of an egg, which he said was a blister,
and which he was ordered to apply to the joint immediately and
to rest at home until the doctor called on him the next day. I
examined his knee, and from the similarity of his symptoms to
those I had myself experienced, I felt satisfied his was a case for
Mr. Hutton and I told him so. He immediately told me he had
heard of my case and so many others that <i>he would rather take
my advice than the doctor’s</i>. I explained to him that he could not
follow the advice of both, and if he decided on going to Mr.
Hutton he must on no account apply the blister. To this he
assented. The doctor’s assistant called on him the next day,
and was very angry that he had not done as he was ordered, and
then left, threatening to return with his master, who he said
would make him put the blister on whether he liked it or not.
This threat however, was not carried out, and on Monday
morning he went to Mr. Hutton with several other patients who
were going up on a similar errand. He did not return until the
last train at night, and I learned next morning that, after
visiting Mr. Hutton, he walked several miles to see a friend and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>then back to the railway station; he rested the next day, and on
Wednesday returned to his work, and has been quite well ever
since.</p>

<p>“The sentence in italics is one to which I desire to call particular
attention, since it gives expression to a feeling of want
of confidence in the profession, which I know to be widely,
though often secretly, entertained in this neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Would it not, then, be to the interest of the profession to
examine into these cases and not obstinately to close their eyes
to facts, which, but for professional prejudice, would not fail to
see as clearly, and reason upon as logically as common people do.</p>

<p class="tb">The publication of Dr. Wharton’s book, added to the
published testimony of so many patients, awakened the
“faculty” to the knowledge that after all there was
something more than luck in the Bone-setter’s art. The
change of tone was however gradual, with occasional relapses
into the old line of thought, not by any means without
misgiving. When professional attention was publicly
drawn to the subject many instances came to light which
showed that Bone-setters proceeded on true scientific
which were neglected by, if not unknown to the faculty
at large. As frequently happens the earliest instance of
professional adoption of the art of the “Bone-setter”
occurred in America. After the publication of Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Hood’s work. A correspondent of <i>Nature</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> seeing a
review of the work wrote to describe an accident he met
with, the failure of the surgeons at New York to cure
him, and his subsequent cure by one he calls “a scientific
Bone-setter” who, of course, was not an “empiric,”
though he adopted the practise of the Bone-setter’s art.
The correspondent in question, Mr. Joseph P. Thompson,
who dates from Berlin, May 22nd, states that more than
<i>twenty</i> years ago in the city of New York, while swinging
upon parallel bars in the gymnasium fell backwards, and
to save his head threw out his left arm, thus catching
the fall upon the palmar head of the radius, and as it
proved fracturing the head of the radius at the point of
articulation with the ulna. I sent for one of the most
eminent surgeons (then professor and surgeon) to a large
hospital, but several hours elapsed before his arrival, and
by that time the swelling and inflammation of the elbow
had all the appearance of a sprain, and the fracture was
not detected. Some days afterwards the surgeon found
out that there had been a fracture, and that a false
adhesion had begun. This was broken up, and the arm
set in splints, according to the approved method. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>the usual time the bandages were removed, but the forearm
was incapable of flexion, extension, or rotation.
Every appliance was used to restore it to its normal
condition, such as lifting, friction, sponging, &amp;c., but
without effect. The arm became useless, and began to
shrivel. It was examined by the first surgeons in New
York and other cities. Some thought that the radius
had adhered to the ulna, others that it was a deposit of
interosseous matter, but none could suggest a remedy.
It was some nine months after this, Mr Thompson goes
on to say, that he chanced to be in Philadelphia, and
called upon Dr. Klea Barton, who, though he had retired
from practice, consented to look into the case. After a
careful examination he said, ‘If you will consent to
suffer the pain, (it was before the use of chloroform) I
will agree to restore the arm.’ He went on to say that
pressure demonstrated a slight crepitation at the joint,
and also a slight elasticity; and this assured him that
the trouble was in the ligaments; that in consequence of
the long imprisonment of the arm in splints, while under
inflammation, a ligamentous adhesion had taken place, and
the synovial fluid had been absorbed. He then applied
one hand firmly to the elbow, and the other to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
palmar end of the radius, and diverting my attention
by anecdote and wit, thus relaxing the resistance of the
will to pain, he gave a sudden wrench, there was a sound
like the ripping of cotton cloth, and the arm lay
outstretched before me, quivering with pain, but capable
of motion. Mechanical appliances for a few weeks, so
far completed the restoration that I have ever since had
about four-fifths of its normal use and power.”</p>

<p>Here was evidently an instance of manipulation,
which, if done by a bone-setter, would be called empirical,
but as it was performed by a retired surgeon, it was
“scientific.” If the benefit is the same, why this difference
of designation? Let the “faculty” reply in person&mdash;“What
in the captain is but a choleric word; in
the soldier is rank blasphemy.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first volume of the British Medical Journal for
1867 opens with a report of a Lecture delivered by Mr.,
now Sir James Paget, Bart., on “Cases that Bone-setters
cure.” The Lecture is the first recognition as far as I
am aware that the profession of the Bone-setters received
at the hands of a professional surgeon, or qualified
medical man, anything more than the opprobrium of
being a “quack,” an empiric, or a charlatan. Ignorance,
presumption, want of skill and knowledge were laid to
the charge of the Bone-setter. His success, if success, as
it admittedly did, attend his efforts to alleviate the anguish
of a sprain, to reduce a fracture or a dislocation, was
attributed to a happy accident, or “luck,” whilst any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>failure, or any mistake, as if failures and mistakes were
never made by those whose names were duly printed in
the <i>Medical Register</i>, was trumpeted always in the medical
journals and in the private coteries frequented by the
local doctors who happened to hear of the case. The
many cures were pooh-poohed, only the failures were
deemed worthy of publicity. It appears to have been
forgotten that not many years have elapsed since the
barber-chirurgeons were the only recognised professors of
surgery. That the present scientific system of surgery
is of comparatively recent date. That there are instances
on record of both physicians and surgeons being tabooed
and denounced because they had wandered from the
beaten path and had found out modes of curing disease
and alleviating suffering which were not known before,
or at least only to a few. The host of appliances
and new methods of treatment are in the opinion of
many old and experienced medical men decidedly unnecessary.
They lead the student and the practitioner to
disregard the empirical&mdash;the practical&mdash;manual part of his
art&mdash;to trust to a mechanical system and not to himself,
or to his personal skill and his experience. No one can
read Sir James Paget’s lecture without feeling that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
throughout his address he was touching a subject that
had only been brought under his notice in the course of
his professional career, and that only in a partial manner.
If anyone dissents from this view he has only to compare
the original report of the lecture in the journal I have
mentioned with the revised lecture and notes, edited by
Mr. Howard Marsh, and published more than twelve
years after the lecture had been first delivered. During
that period, a great change had come over the surgical
world with respect to the much despised Bone-setters.
The greater publicity given to the cures of the Bone-setters
by independent men of mark, who had found their
pains alleviated and their afflictions cured by the professional
Bone-setter, boldly stating their experiences,
told the faculty there must be something more in this
system of “quackery,” than was “dreamt of in their
philosophy.” It was evident, that however distasteful it
might be, it must be treated with respect, even if it
jarred with their previously expressed opinions and
shocked their ideas of strict professional etiquette.</p>

</div>

<p>No Bone-setter can find fault with Sir James Paget’s
lecture beyond his vulgarising, if I may so term it, his
opening illustration. Such an instance might occur, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
there are “Bone-setters and Bone-setters.” The term is
doubtless assumed by many whose practice brings disgrace
upon those who pursue an honorable calling, even
if they do not belong to a chartered society, or are recognised
by Act of Parliament and therefore not “legally
qualified practitioners,” it is true that they are qualified
by long experience, by early training, and the skill
gained by the constant practice of many years, but the
law does not recognise them.</p>

<p>Sir James Paget appears to imagine that all the formula
of a Bone-setter is to say that “a bone is out,” and
to use a wrench to put it in again, which wrench he
admits does good in some cases. He admits “of course
they have a certain number of real fractures and dislocations
which they reduce, and of old ankylosis which they
loosen.” “Of these,” he adds, “I need say nothing; for
I believe there is nothing in their practice in these cases
which is not as well or better done by regular surgical
men.”</p>

<p>He instances what he calls the “rare accident” of the
slipping of a tendon which a wrench may cure, and he is
polite enough to say “I can hardly doubt that a Bone-setter
has occasionally done unwittingly, a lucky trick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
when, with wrenchings and twistings of a joint, he has
made some dislodged tendon slip back into its place.”
Sir James further enumerates a series of cases of injuries
to joints, which may, and indeed are, daily cured by Bone-setters,
and he shows how sometimes patients themselves
may unlock a stiff knee whether caused by loose cartilages,
a stiffness of the muscles, or from other causes.
“It may be admitted generally,” he tells his audience,
“that from paying particular attention to this class of
cases, which are constantly occuring, that the Bone-setters
have achieved their great reputation where eminent surgeons
have failed.” Sir James too dwells on suppositious
cases, which if treated by the Bone-setter’s wrench would
certainly end in mischief, and alludes to bad boys who
simulate stiff joints who often “escape disgrace by lying
and letting the Bone-setter be believed when he professes
that he has ‘put in’ their dislocations.” “Amongst all
these cases of muscular difficulty,” Sir James says, “there
is a good harvest for Bone-setters and without doubt
their remedy is rough as it is real.” “But,” he continues,
“there is yet a larger class of cases which Bone-setters
sometimes succeed in curing very quickly, namely, ordinary
sprains.” “I cannot doubt,” he says, “that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
recently sprained joints may be quickly cured, freed
from pain, and restored to useful power, by gradually
increased violence of rubbing and moving.” He admits
that this has sometimes been introduced into regular
surgery, but, he goes on to state, that it is in cases where
old sprains have remained long uncured that Bone-setters,
and especially those who combine rubbing and
shampooing with their setting, gain their chief repute.
He, therefore, cautions the surgeons against giving too
much rest, to avoid cold joints, excessive exercise, and try
more gentle methods than are popularly attributed to
the Bone-setter, as if the latter gloated over causing
pain, which is not the case, though he often thinks that
one sharp pang is better than days of agony, and, when
over, his patient always coincides with him. The great
Master-Surgeon also points out that what are called
“hysterical joints” afford a rare opportunity for a
victory for a Bone-setter, which may be cured by sheer
audacity of being pulled about.</p>

<p>“From this you may see,” says Sir James, “that the
cases that the Bone-setters may cure are not a few, but,”
he continues, “the <i>lessons which you may learn from their
practice are plain and useful</i>. Many more cases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
injured joints than one commonly supposed to be thus
curable may be successfully treated with rough movements.”</p>

<p>“Learn, then, to imitate what is good, and avoid
what is bad in the practice of Bone-setters; and if you
would still further observe the rule, <i>Fas est ab hoste
doceri</i>, which in no calling is wiser than in ours, learn
next what you can from the practice of rubbers and
plasterers; for these know many clever tricks; and if
they had but educated brains to guide their strong and
pliant hands, they might be most skilful curers of bad
joints, and of many other hindrances of locomotion.”</p>

<p>Such is in brief the testimony of the great Master-Surgeon
of the age to the methods of practice adopted
by the Bone-setters, who have practised their art as
their fathers and grandfathers have done before them.
His testimony at least shows that the Bone-setter works
on truly scientific grounds, and that he is not a mere
“lucky trickster,” a charlatan who works on the credulity
of the public for the sake of gain, pretending to cure
others by his own conceit. As I have before pointed
out, Sir James Paget himself had occasion to modify his
originally expressed opinion when the process and mode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
of cure practised by the late Mr. Richard Hutton was
explained by Dr. Wharton Hood.</p>

<p>To this gentleman the profession and the public were
indebted for the first published authoritative account of
the Bone-setter’s art. There are but few Bone-setters
who will say that Dr. Hood has exhausted the subject,
for he has not; he has only indicated a few salient points,
in which the practice of Mr. Hutton varied materially
from that taught in surgical schools. He showed that
more might be done in the surgical world by the leverage
of the limbs, than by the employment of complicated
and expensive apparatus. He bemoaned the “cost and
loss” which the practitioners of surgery have sustained
by the resort of patients, affected by impaired mobility
or usefulness of limbs, after disease or injury to the
Bone-setters, who so frequently give relief and speedily
cure a patient by their manipulations and treatment. It
is but just to Dr. Hood to say that he has given a number
of cases illustrative of his statements, which the
faculty have “condescended” to notice, and some of
which, in my desire to give the widest illustrations of the
usefulness of the Bone-setter’s art, I have embodied in
this treatise. He dwells somewhat on the supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
that all Bone-setters declare that “a bone is out” in
every case of thickened or stiff joint that is brought to
them, but he seems to forget that these are only a fraction
of the “cases which Bone-setters cure,” and on
which our reputation so securely rests. The quarry men
of North Wales, as detailed in the <i>British Medical
Journal</i>, in 1875, preferred Mr. Thomas Evans, of
Pen-y-groes, to their old regular medical practitioner in
cases of external injury to body or limb, and though the
profession were indignant at any medical men, being
associated with a mere Bone-setter in the rules of
Friendly Society or Sick Club, the connection is not
unfrequent. The faculty have evidently much to learn
ere they can successfully compete with Bone-setters in
the special cases to which they devote their time,
abilities and attention. The patients are the best judges
of results, and by results the surgeon must be judged.
Their case is not helped by detailing how a Chinese
farrier killed a girl the Emperor desired to marry, by
forcibly straightening her hump-back, as recorded in page
900 of the <i>Lancet</i> for 1872. It is far better for them to
admit as Dr. G. Reed admitted in the same journal that
he “had his eye wiped” by a Bone-setter, at Liverpool,
who cured a sailor whom he failed to relieve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout the medical publications from 1871 to
1880, there are frequent allusions to the bone-setter and
several admissions by surgical practitioners,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> that they
have followed the method of the bone-setter with success,
and discarded therefore the teaching of the schools;
for though the <i>Lancet</i> itself welcomed Dr. Wharton
Hood’s exposition of the art of the Bone-setter, as tending
“to afford the means for the suppression of a widely
prevalent and <i>very mischievous</i> form of quackery which
has been based, as every <i>success</i> of the kind must be upon
some <i>neglected</i> or <i>forgotten</i> truth. The late Mr. Hutton,
on whose practise, Dr. Wharton Hood’s papers are
founded, was for many years a sort of bugbear to not a
few of the most distinguished surgeons of London, and
every few months some fresh case was heard of in which
he had given immediate relief and speedy cure to a patient
who seemed vainly to have exhausted the legitimate
skill of the metropolis.” This is an admission somewhat
at variance with its previous utterances, and not as
frank as the organ of a boasted liberal profession should
be, and is far from generous, for its tone is embittered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>
<p>It however goes on to say, that “in some country places
and especially in mining districts, in which large labouring
populations are much exposed to chances of injury,
bone-setters become formidable opponents to regular
practitioners, and, like their London representative, have
their surprising cures to boast. It is true that they
often inflict injury; but this is not the aspect of the
case to which our attention should be first directed.
They are not valued because they do harm, but because
they do a certain amount of good; and the way in
which this good is brought about is the matter of
chief interest to the profession.” The <i>Lancet</i> goes
on to say “that quackery is only an expression of
the extent to which legitimate practitioners fail to meet
the desires of the sick,” and then somewhat unfairly
and unjustly introduces the quack who pretends to cure
phthisis or other mortal illness, as if Bone-setters professed
impossibilities. After this inconsistent divergence
it points out “that in the particular in question (the art
of the Bone-setter) it is incontestible that a large number
of irritable and useless joints have been restored to a
natural condition by Bone-setters after a long period of
unavailing surgical treatment, and that the profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
has not known how this desirable result has been produced,
or what has been the true nature of the lesion
treated. The quack always said that a bone was “out”
and that he had replaced it, and the doctor knew quite
well that these statements were not correct. The doctor
would not meet the quack; and the quack kept his
methods secret, and would not show them to the doctor.
The quack obtained more credit for a cure after the
doctor had failed, than the doctor for a hundred cures in
an ordinary course; and the Bone-setter, of all quacks
was the one who did most to injure the reputation of the
profession.</p>

<p>We once heard a military man of considerable distinction
describe how his son was instantly cured of a
sprained knee by Hutton, after a distinguished hospital
surgeon had treated him to no purpose; and the speaker
wound up with the remark ‘you doctors are all duffers.’</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt2">******</span></p>

<p>“At all events, for good or evil, the treatment pursued
by Bone-setters will now be fairly before the profession
and scientifically educated surgeons will soon be in a
position to define accurately its merits, its dangers, and
the limitations of its usefulness. Its application by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
ignorant men to unsuitable cases has often been followed
by injurious consequences; but no such consequences
ought to occur in the hands of the profession. We have
little doubt that Dr. Wharton Hood has really called
attention to a neglected corner of the domain of surgery,
to morbid conditions that have been only very faintly
described in books, and scarcely at all recognised in
practice, to precautions that have been either unfounded
or exaggerated, and to a method of cure at once simple
and intelligible. We hope to see as the result of his
labour, that the art of the Bone-setters will become
extinct, after having been for a time exercised only upon
those cases for which treatment by movement would be
really unsuitable, and, as a necessary consequence, hurtful
instead of curative.</p>

<p>“There may be other forms of quackery also under
which some valuable knowledge may lie concealed; and
no better service can be rendered to the profession or
the public than to bring quack knowledge to the light
of day, and to make it available for the general good.”</p>

<p>The publication of Dr. Wharton Hood’s book had
however a different effect on the public mind than what
was intended. There was previously a sort of general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
belief that the doctors might be right in dubbing Bone-setters
“quacks” without much discrimination as to who
the bone-setter was. Some of the complaints which
appeared in the <i>Lancet</i> prior to this, were like the
petulant utterances of a child deprived of its plaything,
rather than the opinions of a scientific inquirer, for it
must have struck the thinking part of the faculty, as it
subsequently did Sir James Paget, and gleamed on
the writer in the <i>Lancet</i>, that the fame of the many
cures could not have been the effect of chance, or
the “luck” of ignorant charlatans. Mr. Archibald
Maclaren, who noticed Dr. Hood’s book in <i>Nature</i>, seems
to have been aware of this. He pertinently says with
reference to his work <i>On Bone-setting</i>, “It will be asked,
What is Bone-setting, who are the Bone-setters, and
who are their patients? And it will be readily answered
Why, of course, Bone-setting is the art of setting bones
that have been broken, or joints that have been dislocated,
and this is done doubtless by surgeons; and equally
doubtless, and of course their patients are persons whose
bones are fractured, or whose joints are dislocated&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">“There needs no ghost come from</div>
<div class="line">The grave to tell us that.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps not, but the answer is quite wrong for all that;
quite the reverse, indeed, of what is actually the case,
for <i>Bone-setting is</i> <span class="smcap">NOT</span> <i>the art of re-setting broken bones or
dislocated joints; Bone-setters are</i> <span class="smcap">NOT</span> <i>surgeons</i>, or regular
practitioners in any sense of the title; and then patients,
even when they have suffered injury to joint or bone,
have been pronounced by the regular practitioner <i>cured</i>
before seeking the help of the Bone-setter.”</p>

<p>The writer very properly calls this “a triple paradox,”
and quotes what Dr. Hood has to say in explanation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A healthy man sustains a fracture of one or both bones of
the forearm, and applies at a hospital, where splints are adapted
in the usual way. He is made an out-patient, and the splints
are occasionally taken off and replaced.</p>

<p>“After the lapse of a certain number of weeks the fracture
becomes firmly united, the splints are laid aside, and the man is
discharged cured. He is still unable to use either his hand or
his forearm, but is assured that his difficulty arises only from the
stiffness incidental to long rest of them, and that it will soon
disappear. Instead of disappearing, it rather increases, and in
due time he seeks the aid of the Bone-setter. The arm and forearm
are then bent nearly at a right angle to each other; the
forearm is intermediate between pronation and supenation; the
hand in a line with it; and the fingers straight and rigid, the
patient being unable to move them, and also unable to move
either the wrist or elbow. Passive motion can be accomplished
within narrow limits, thus produces sharp pain, distinctly
localised in some single spot about each joint, in which spot
there will be also tenderness in pressure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>
<p>“The Bone-setter will tell the man that his wrist and his elbow
are “out.” The man may object that the injury has been in
the middle of the forearm, perhaps from a blow or other direct
violence. The reply be then; perhaps the arm had indeed been
broken as alleged, but that the wrist and the elbow had been put
out at the same time, and that these injuries had been overlooked
by the doctors. The Bone-setters would then, by a rapid
manipulation hereafter to be described, at once overcome the
stiffness of the fingers, and enabled the patient to move them to
and fro. The instant benefit received would dispel all scruples
about submitting the wrist and elbow to manipulation, and these
also would be set free in their turn. The man would go away
easily flexing and extending his lately rigid joints, and fully
convinced that he had sustained grievous harm at the hands
of his legitimate doctors.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“The art of Bone-setting, then, is the art of overcoming
these impediments in joints, these conditions or
impaired freedom which not unfrequently supervene on
the curative processes of treatment in use by surgeons
in case of fracture or dislocation, or which may arise
from and be observed only after the subsidence of active
rheumatism, gout, gangrene swellings, or other local
affections; and this brings us to the question&mdash;How is it
done? how are these stiffened joints set free? how are
these impediments to healthy action overcome? The
answer of the regular practitioner is that which has been
already quoted, namely&mdash;‘to rest it’&mdash;advice which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
usually entails a distressing failure; the answer of the
irregular practitioner, <i>i.e.</i>, the Bone-setter, is precisely
the opposite, namely&mdash;that freedom can only be restored
to the stiffened joint by movement, by manipulation, and
manipulation, too, of the most formidable kind, nothing
less than suddenly and forcibly rupturing, tearing asunder
the adhesions formed between the articulating surfaces of
the affected joint, an operation which is so frequently
successful that it forms the very basis of the Bone-setter’s
craft.”</p>

<p>This is very forcibly and clearly expressed, but its
verbiage tends somewhat to place the Bone-setter in a
formidable and forbidding light, as opposed to the regular
practitioner, but as a matter of every-day experience such
is not the case. It is true, that the injury of years cannot
be removed in a twinkle of an eye, without the patient
suffering any pain or inconvenience. No bone-setter
pretends to do that, but his mode of procedure is not of
that violent and repellant character which Mr. Maclaren’s
words would seem to imply:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is here,” continues Mr. Maclaren, “that the
Bone-setter steps in front of the scientific surgeon, <i>and
we must confess to a feeling of disappointment that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
relative positions are not reversed</i>, that the surgeon is not
called in to rectify the malpractices of the quack, instead
of the latter being sought out to complete the shortcomings
of the former.” These are not our words, but
the words of an independent reviewer in a scientific periodical.
He tells his readers that the Bone-setter is not a
man with only one remedy and one resource, but that
“he has a clearly defined system of treatment for each
separate joint, if not for each specific affection to which
each joint is subject.” What qualified surgeon, what
regular practitioner has more than that? He follows
the dogma and doctrine of the schools. The Bone-setter
that of experience, practice and the traditions of generations
of practitioners. The one is recognised by law, and
the other is not.</p>

<p>Mr. Maclaren seems to have seen that there was something
which required explanation in all this. With
the facts in Dr. Hood’s book before him, he says “Bone-setters,
we are told, are for the most part uneducated
men, wholely ignorant of anatomy and pathology.” In
the anecdotes of Mr. Hutton, this is always accentuated
in the professional accounts of his proceedings, for he made
a little boast of his ignorance, but the writer continues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
“we are not told what we greatly wish to know, and
that is, the manner and method in which the secrets,
the mysteries, and the other traditions of the craft, are
communicated to each other.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> No doubt there exists
a freemasonry in the craft, so that when individual
members meet, revelations are made and notes compared,
but we are not informed of any regular or organised
system of instruction, either for the maintenance and
extension of the craft, as a craft, or for the enlightenment
of the separate and detached members of the
fraternity. The most celebrated, we may even say distinguished,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
Bone-setter of our day, was the late Mr.
Hutton, whose successful treatment of cases which had
baffled the skill of the foremost surgeons now living, as
related in detail by Dr. Hood, and about the accuracy of
which there can be no question or doubt, is little short
of marvellous; and the question is ever recurrent, while
we read ‘How and where was this skill acquired?’ for
a Bone-setter of Mr. Hutton’s calibre could put his finger
on the spot, where lurked the seat of an affection that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>crippled a patient for half a dozen years, and had defied
the scientific treatment of the ablest surgeons of our
time; nay, he could point to this spot without ever
seeing the limb affected, guided merely by observing the
attitude, gait, or action of the patient. Now whence
comes this skill of these illiterate men? It appears to
have been gained solely by observation of symptoms and
results of treatment, the accumulated knowledge of from
day-to-day experience; and, as we often see that one
sense is quickened and functional power increased by the
loss or impairment of some other sense; so, perhaps, the
narrowing of the field of instruction and counting of the
sources of information, may have intensified the powers of
observation of the Bone-setters, allowing in a measure for
the absence of the revelations of science.”</p>

<p>Is not this equally applicable to the oculist, the aurist,
the dentist, and to the “specialist” of every description.
The Bone-setter keeps within his special knowledge, and
though he may be called “a quack,” he can point to the
results of his skill and experience, and ask if these are
quackery? The patients, whose sufferings have been
alleviated, <i>must</i> answer, “If this is quackery, we wish
there was more of it in the world.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> the Royal Society, when Charles II. asked that
learned body the answer to certain propositions, the
medical profession continued for years to “hum and haw”
over the self-evident fact that Bone-setting was not only
an institution, but a successful profession. I have taken
somewhat at random from my voluminous collection of
notes on the subject, a few of the printed opinions of

<p>In 1880, the Clinical Society, at their meeting, held
on April 9, had the subject of “Bone-setting” under
discussion. Mr. Howard Marsh, whose experience is
elsewhere given (page 95) gave instances of a number
of cases he had treated after the Bone-setter’s manner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>and which had been quite successful. He gave his
testimony to the great service Sir James Paget had
rendered to the profession by drawing attention to the
subject in his clinical lectures which had since been republished
with others (see pp. 69-74). He further said that
<i>displacements of cartilages, and slipped tendons might be,
and doubtless sometimes were, put right by Bone-setters;
but he believed the cases of adhesions&mdash;especially such as
occurred after an injury outside a joint</i>, which itself was
healthy, afforded by far the most numerous instances of
improvement after forcible movement, and he expressed
his conviction that they were much more frequent in
practice than was generally supposed. He gave other
several instances where he had followed the Bone-setter’s
treatment as given by Dr. Wharton Hood. He, of
course, was silent as to the practice of the Bone-setters
in reducing fractures, and their treatment of cases which
never came under the care of the faculty at all, and
which were satisfactory to the patients.</p>

<p>Mr. Hulke thought it was an approbrium to surgery
that so many persons sought advice from Bone-setters,
and he mentioned that “even intelligent people are
blinded by these men!” Many alleged instances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
injury following the treatment of the Bone-setter, but
there was a little contemptuous tone with respect to
country surgeons, which ere long evoked a reply.</p>

<p>In the next number of the <i>Lancet</i>, there appeared a
letter from Dr. D. H. Monckton, of Rugeley, pointing
out that it would seem “that the chief object sought in
the debate was to prove to country surgeons that their
metropolitan brethren understand, and can cure such
conditions of the joints if only they are sent up to
them.” In other words, they want to occupy the place
and receive the fees of the ousted Bone-setters, whose
secrets they had appropriated, after covering them with
approbrium as quacks and empirics.</p>

<p>At another meeting of the profession there was the
same <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> argumentation. The obvious “willingness
to wound,” but yet “afraid to strike” in the face
of the overwhelming testimony in favour of the <i>bete noir</i>
of the profession:&mdash;the healer outside the fold “who in
the wilderness doth stray.” At this meeting Dr. Bruce
Clarke read a paper on the practice of the Bone-setter,
in which after briefly alluding to the variety of cases
that found their way to the Bone-setter, and derived
benefits from his treatment, he adverted to the pathology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of stiff joints, and showed from observations of several
cases which he had been able to examine after removal of
the limb, that adhesions were usually found outside
joints and tendon sheaths, and were due to contractions
of the connective tissue of the limb. Adhesions were
rarely formed inside the tendon sheaths or joints, and
when they were, the disease was far more serious and
rarely yielded to treatment. In cases of old stiff joints,
the skin, and probably the subcutaneous tissues, became
weakened and atrophied by disease, and were so rendered
more liable to injury&mdash;in proof of which he cited several
examples of tearing and lacerating the skin without the
employment of due violence. The usual history, he
tells us, of the class of cases that came under the hands
of the Bone-setter was this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The patient met with an injury resulting in a dislocation,
or fracture, or perhaps, only a severe bruise, or a
sprain. He readily recovered up to a certain point; but
when all inflammation had subsided, there remained a
stiffness accompanied by pain on movement. In other
cases there were periodical attacks of synotictus. The
treatment in all such cases was active movement, with or
without chloroform, which was usually accompanied by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
click or crack, ascribed by the Bone-setter to the replacement
of a bone, but which was due to the freeing of
the connective tissue bands. In slight cases, one violent
flexion might cure the trouble of months: in severe cases,
the treatment might be measured by months rather than
minutes. The pathology of such cases was as well
marked as that of iritis, where there was the advantage
of seeing the adhesions not only form but rupture and
disappear. He expressed his obligation to Mr. Wharton
Hood’s lecture which had induced him to study the
subject. The difficulty of these cases was the selection
of time for rupture, and for rest. Signs of inflammation
were their guides in that matter. Rest should be regulated
to its proper position in surgery, and should not be
kept up when it increased instead of abating the patients’
troubles.</p>

<p>Dr. Keetley thought Dr. Clarke could hardly have
chosen a more interesting subject, undoubtedly, the
Bone-setter frequently earned great credit by the manipulations
which broke down adhesions outside a joint, and
at the same time, removed the cause of inflammation,
for in these cases there was no contraction of membrane.
When there was an osseous fibrous hand the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
was of a strumous origin, it was due to the presence of
organisms. In such cases the joints became altered, and
there was great danger from the rough usage of the Bone-setter.
In the treatment of such joints he had put on ice
for several days with great advantage, and had repeatedly
put them straight. When once convalescent, a joint very
rarely became strumous. There was much bewilderment
with regard to the value of rest, which was only a negative
factor. It was the natural tendency of a column of
germs to die as the joint became healthy.</p>

<p>Dr. Alderson related the case of a knee which became
enlarged fourteen days after confinement, but without
pain. He called in Dr. Hewitt who ordered rest, and
the knee to be rubbed with salad oil. He also used
Scott’s dressing. Subsequently, at Brighton, a sea-weed
poultice was used. The treatment was successful.</p>

<p>Dr. Alden Owles had seen several cases confirmatory of
the opinions advanced in the paper. Once was a shoulder,
the manipulation of which caused agony to the patient,
but in which motion was regained. Another regarded at
first as a strumous joint was eventually cured by somewhat
violent manipulation.</p>

<p>Dr. Vinen referred to the case of an officer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
60th Regiment, who sustained a compound fracture below
the knee whilst playing at football in India. The
bones were set by some naval surgeons who were watching
the game; but in consequence of the leg being deformed,
the adhesions were broken and the limb reset.
The ankle then remained fixed, and the patient’s health
suffered. However, Mr. Erichsen was called in, broke
the adhesion, and the patient recovered so thoroughly,
that he was enabled to rejoin his battalion in the
Transvaal. Dr. Bruce Clarke in reply, pointed out the
necessity of distinguishing chronic cases, as such were
usually made worse by movement.</p>

<p>In the course of this discussion only one point of the
Bone-setter’s practice was alluded to&mdash;that of rigid or
strumous joints, as if the renown of the Bone-setters art
rested on these alone. “There are none so blind as those
who will not see.”</p>

<i>DISPARAGEMENT AND VINDICATION.</i></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">“Who shall decide when doctors disagree?”</p></blockquote>

<hr class="short" />
<p>Dr. Howard Marsh, the learned Editor of Sir James
Paget’s Lectures, who had previously been subjected to
the criticism of country practitioners for his somewhat
supercilious allusion to their failure to adopt the processes
of the Bone-setter, thought it becoming at the
jubilee meeting of the British Medical Association at
Worcester in 1882, to resume the worn-out sneer at the
Bone-setter’s ignorance and superstition. He seems,
indeed, to have drawn on his imagination for his facts,
or to have resuscitated the history of his own profession
for that of the modern Bone-setter. From his high
and mighty stand-point he told the assembled medical
practitioners in the “faithful city” this faithless
story:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bone-setters are a very miscellaneous group, who
resemble each other mainly in the negative point, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
they have never studied either anatomy, pathology, or
surgery. Some are blacksmiths on the Cumberland
hills, or shepherds in the sequestered valleys of Wales.
Practitioners of this kind, standing in the same relation
to surgery that herbalists bear to medicine, have existed
in these remote districts from immemorial times. They
belong to the same order which in bye-gone times
included fortune-tellers, ring-charmers, and the workers
of all kind of village miracles. At the other end of the
scale are practitioners of a less unsophisticated stamp.
Residing in large towns they equip themselves with the
names of the principal bones and muscles, and with a
few stock medical phrases they procure a skeleton
on which they undertake to show patients the precise
nature of their complaints; they employ anæsthetics
freely, and make full use of daily passive movements,
rubbing and shampooing; while in spinal cases they
often put on Sayre’s plaster jacket. These individuals
however, are in the same position as the most homely
of their order in this important particular&mdash;that diagnosis,
properly so called, forms no part of their system.
Indeed, diagnosis and their method are two things
incompatible. At present, the Bone-setter’s programme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
is both concise and logical. In every case alike he asserts
that “a bone is out,” and that he can put it in. Now,
the second clause of this formula postulates the first.
But let him once enter upon diagnosis&mdash;let him once
find, not that a bone is out, but that the case is one of
tumour, or paralysis, and he has cut the ground from
under his own feet. No. Beyond the assertion that “a
bone is out” or similar phrase, he never goes. If pressed
for particulars, he cuts the knot by saying, “I can cure
you&mdash;what more do you want?” Old Mr. Hutton, of
Watford, used to say, “Don’t bother me with anatomy&mdash;I
know nothing about it.” A patient, therefore, who
consults a Bone-setter, is simply playing a game of
hazard. His fate depends on what is the matter with
him. If he has a stiff ankle after a sprain he will very
likely be cured. If he has a strumous joint he will be
more or less injured, while if he has a bunion, or a node
on his tibia, he will find himself neither better nor worse
for his venture.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt2">******</span></p>

<p>I have quoted Mr. Howard Marsh thus far without
comment in order to show that he is something like the
Old Bailey advocate, who thinks to serve his clients best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
by abusing the attorney on the opposite side. He seems
neither to have learned Sir James Paget’s admissions,
or was anxious to pose as a dogmatic teacher at the
expense alike of truth and experience. His whole knowledge
and deductions are made from the two or three
cases related by Dr. Wharton Hood, for so learned a
doctor was not likely to look for facts in the domain of
general literature outside the schools. He then proceeded
to say&mdash;“But how is it that Bone-setters sometimes
succeed where surgeons have failed? My answer
is the following:&mdash;There are a considerable number
of minor ailments of and around the joints that interfere
with free movement, or produce pain, such as adhesions,
slipped tendons, hysterical affections, rigidity of
the muscles, &amp;c. These conditions, though they differ
widely from each other, and are met with under a great
variety of circumstances, have yet this one point in
common, that they may be cured by free movement.</p>

<p>“Now, how have Bone-setting and surgery respectively
dealt with these cases? What is Bone-setting?
Bone-setting is a system embodied in a single clause.
Ignoring alike anatomy, pathology, and diagnosis, it
begins and ends in a summary act of treatment. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
consists in the process of carrying the affected joint
through its full natural range of movement in all directions,
especially in the direction in which there is the
greatest resistance. Thus, a Bone-setter, who says, in
every case alike that a bone is out, and that he can put it
in, is like a practitioner who should tell all his patients
alike that their complaint was constipation, and should
promise to cure them all with sulphate of magnesia.
Now, although sulphate of magnesia given for strangulated
hernia or typhoid, or Bone-setting employed for
sarcoma or a scrofulous joint, can do nothing but harm,
there are many cases in which both these agents do real
good; and these genuine successes, like the fragment of
truth that lies at the bottom of every method which
shows any sustained vitality, are enough, when they are
seen through the glamour that surrounds this system to
outweigh in the eyes of the public the failures that stand
on the other side of the account. How has it been with
surgery? Surgery is no stranger to the use of manipulation.
The method has frequently been employed, and
is fully discussed in the writings of many surgical
authorities; but it has always been unpopular; and for
this reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>It has been used mainly in cases in which limbs have
been left stiff or distorted after the subsidence of serious
disease of the joints themselves, and the result has been
disappointing. The joint though yielding freely under
manipulation, has usually grown stiff again; and not
rarely there has been a fresh outbreak of the original
disease. These, however, are not the cases which are
suitable for this method. If the secreting structure of
the synovial membrane has once been destroyed, or if the
cartilage has been removed and replaced by adhesions, the
joint is practically converted into a cicatrix, and
although that cicatrix may be completely torn across
the functions of the articulations cannot be restored.
The effect of these cases has been that, finding they
have done no good, and sometimes even harm, surgeons
have too much discarded manipulative treatment, and
have too exclusively adopted the motto <i>non vi arte</i>.
Thus it has happened that Bone-setters, helped by their
ignorance, have stumbled on success, while surgeons,
deterred by the unsatisfactory results, met with in a
particular group of cases, have refrained from manipulation
in instances in which it is the only treatment
that is likely to be efficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>I have said that a Bone-setter’s formula is, that a bone
is out, and that he can put it in. To do this he carries
the limb through all its natural range of movement,
and he stops only when all resistance has been overcome.
Thus, if a knee is flexed, it has to go straight
just as a horse that jibs at a fence&mdash;if he happen to
have a rough rider on his back&mdash;has to go over it.
In the majority of cases, however, the force that is
used in a majority of cases is absolutely slight; for,
in the first place, an anæsthetic is often given, so that
the muscles being relaxed, the effort used takes effect
directly on the source of abnormal resistance, whatever
that may be. Secondly, Bone-setters acquire by practice
much facility in handling and moving the various joints;
they know how to seize the limb at a advantage, not only
with the force, but with the skill of a wrestler; and
thirdly, in cases in which an anæsthetic is not given, they
take care to divert their patients’ attention so that the
muscles are off their guard.</p>

<p>In the common run of cases in which Bone-setters succeed,
very moderate force is sufficient to break down all
resistance that is encountered. This latter is a very
important point. The main objection entertained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
surgeons to manipulation is that it is a resort to violence;
it is <i>vi non arte</i>. This view, however, if founded
mainly on the experience of cases in which fibrous ankylosis
of the larger joints has been broken down. But
these, I venture to repeat, are not the cases by which to
judge this method. I can recall but few cases in which
free motion has been restored to a joint that could be
moved only by the use of considerable force. The most
striking successes are obtained in instances in which some
slight impediment to motion is easily overcome. Indeed,
it may be taken as an axiom&mdash;almost, perhaps, self evident,
that the less the force which is required to remove the
impediment, the more successful will be the result. Thus
so far from the opinion being a correct one, that manipulation
is necessarily a resort to violence; the truth is, that
in appropriate cases, force which could inflict injury on the
natural structures is very seldom required. I think when
this fact is more clearly recognised, much of the distrust
now entertained respecting manipulative treatment will
have been removed.”</p>

<p>Thus Dr. Howard Marsh argues admittedly on the
slightest and most imperfect knowledge of the Bone-setter’s
art and their method of procedure. He is kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>enough to admit that they sometimes reduce recent
dislocations, disperse a bursa, and succeed in nervous
so-called hysterical joints and spines. (See George
Moore’s case, 29-32 <i>ante</i>.) They sometimes, he admits,
“replace a slipped tendon,” and operate successfully in
cases of internal derangement of the knee joint, and in
relieving joints which, though healthy, are stiffened and
painful from surrounding adhesions. He approves to
some extent of manipulations, and his whole paper is one
of disparagement, or “damning with faint praise.”</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>Lest it should be thought that I have only my own
authority for calling in question Dr. Howard Marsh’s
dogmatic assertions with respect to the method of practice
by modern Bone-setters I find at the same medical
jubilee, Mr. R. Dacre Fox, Fellow of the Royal College of
Surgeons, of Edinburgh, the surgeon to the Southern
Hospital, Manchester; surgeon to the Manchester police
force, and whose other practice and official appointments
entitle his opinion to some weight, gave his practical experience
of the Bone-setter’s art, so entirely different and
so much nearer the truth, that I shall content myself with
merely quoting, whilst thanking him, for his remarks
which appeared in the <i>Lancet</i>, for 1882 (vol. ii. pp.
844.) Speaking from three years’ experience with the
late Mr. Taylor, a celebrated bone-setter at Whitworth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Lancashire, whose family have been bone-setters for more
than two hundred years, he told the medical men in
plain terms that, “Much misconception exists as to
the practice of Bone-setters; many of the methods
of treatment popularly attributed to them have no
other existence than in the imagination of ignorant
patients, whose stories we, as a profession, are
perhaps rather too ready to believe. It is certain
that some families&mdash;notably the Taylors, Huttons, and
Masons&mdash;have by their manipulative and mechanical
skill justly acquired a great reputation. In what has their
practice consisted? First, in the treatment of fractures
and correction of deformities. The general impression
in the profession appears to be that the Bone-setter’s art
consists of nothing more or less than the forcible “breaking
up” of stiff joints, so as to make the same man walk
as if by a miracle. The practice at Whitworth was a large
one, furnishing constant employment for at least two
active men, and consisting chiefly of the cases I have
mentioned. Speaking from memory, I do not believe
that fifty joints of all sorts were “cracked up” during
the time I was there; but it was not an uncommon event
to have to put up half a dozen fresh fractures and twice as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
many recent sprains in a single morning. In the North
of England, the origin of nearly all the men who are fairly
good at Bone-setting can be traced to the Whitworth
surgery, and while, so far as I know, the Taylors, in their
various settlements at Whitworth, Todmorden, Stock-wood,
and Oldfield-lane, were the only qualified surgeons
who practised Bone-setting; amongst the hills and dales
of Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the Lake district, there
were many who did so without being qualified, some of
whom, I must in fairness say, put up fractures uncommonly
well. But apart from the legitimate credit they
have won by the skill displayed in their handicraft, they
owe some of their success to the carelessness or indifference
of the general body of practitioners, who are apt to
overlook little injuries which often become very painful
and troublesome. It sometimes seems to me that it is
beneath the dignity of the ordinary practitioner to employ
any active treatment whatever for a sprain. It is
hardly fair then to guage the work of Bone-setters solely
by their method of treating diseased joints (probably the
most unsatisfactory class of cases in the whole realm of
surgery), but we ought also to take into account the
patience and skill they display in the treatment of inju<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>ries
for which they are not unfrequently consulted by the
patients of qualified practitioners. I have no desire to
hold a brief for every idle fellow who calls himself a
Bone-setter, but I am anxious to give credit where credit
is due, and to explain that the <i>art</i> of Bone-setting is not
what it is often thought to be a mere mixture of charlantanism

<p>From my own experience, I should classify weak joints
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="margin">1.&mdash;Those that have become stiff from enforced
rest.</p>

<p class="margin">2.&mdash;Those that have become stiff by chronic disease.</p>

<p class="margin">3.&mdash;Joints stiff from injury to the bones entering
into their formation.</p>

<p class="margin">4.&mdash;Joints stiff and weak from sprains, including
displacement of tendons and partial luxation.</p>

<p>Apart from the previous history of the case, and the
evident existence of constitutional disease, there are some
external appearances which help to distinguish cases and
to afford indications of treatment, and of these the Bone-setters
have learned by experience to avail themselves.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;In the first-class I have mentioned the stiffness of
the structures about the joint impeding its movement is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
the result of purely mechanical causes, is in fact simply
due to prolonged disuse. No cause for functional activity
exists, and consequently the elasticity, the flexibility and
power of adaptation to movement in the parts about the
joints not being required they become stiff and rigid. No
degenerative changes however taking place, and they are
capable of being recalled into activity unimpaired. In
such a joint, the bony points, and the outlines of the
tendons and ligaments about it, seem unnaturally prominent,
probably from absorption of the adipose and connective
tissue; the rigid ligaments impart a sense of
hardness, and if the limb be flexed to its utmost, it shows
considerable resilliency, such joints may, I believe, be
“cracked up” without fear of consequences, and this
constitutes one of the successful operations of Bone-setters.
My own recollection carries me back to some
apparently almost miraculous results. I am convinced
<i>suddenness ought</i> to be insisted on in doing this; the
advantage derived from it being, I believe, mainly due to
the fact, that it is less likely to set up any irritation in the
joint than the “dragging” of gradual extension.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;In the next class of cases, in which stiffness is due
to degenerative changes, the external appearances are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
exactly reversed, the outlines of the joint are more or less
gone. In these cases, no matter the character of the disease,
manipulative interference is positively vicious; and
while it is in them that ignorant Bone-setters do so much
mischief, the better informed, by the use of splints and
well applied pressure, are highly successful in their treatment.
I am sorry to say many cases of this kind come to
Bone-setters which have not been properly treated before,
owing to their not having been recognised, especially hip-joint
disease.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;On the third-class of cases, in which a fracture has
taken place into the joint, causing stiffness, the condition
is due to disturbed relationship of the bones from faulty
setting, and is recognised by comparison with the bony
landmarks of the sound limb. In these cases forcible
treatment does good; though, of course, the result is in
proportion to the amount of bone-displacement, but it
should be supplemented by passive movements for some
time. In joints stiff after diagonal fracture through the
condyles of the humerus so common in children, I have
seen many most gratifying results; one in a boy about
twelve years old, whose elbow had been stiff three years is
especially impressed on my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>4.&mdash;In the fourth-class of cases, and those to which I
would draw particular attention, I include lameness, and
weakness, the result of the various forms of injury, which
we group together under the general term a “sprain.”
I affirm most unhesitatingly, from an experience of some
hundreds of cases, that nothing has done more to lower
the prestige of regular practitioners, and to play into the
hands of unqualified Bone-setters, than the way in which
so many practitioners tamper with a sprained joint.
Sprains, of course, vary greatly in severity; they may be
broadly divided into two kinds, of which one consists
merely of a temporary over distention of the parts round
a joint which rest, and anodyne applications soon cure,
while the other involves pathological results a much more
serious nature. A <i>severe</i> sprain is the sum of the injuries
that the parts in and about a joint sustain, when, by their
passive efforts, they exercise their maximum power of
restraint to prevent luxation. Under such conditions I
conceive the following changes to take place in the integrity
of a joint. In the case of the synovial membrane,
temporary hyperæmia accompanied by pain, and some
slight effusion into the cavity of the joint.</p>

<p>In the case of the tendons, over-stretching and loosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>ing
of the lining membrane of their sheaths, more or less
disturbance to the adjacent cellular tissue forming the
bed of the tendon groove, and hyperæmia with exudation
of plastic fluid, subsequently forming adventitious products.
In the case of the non-elastic fibrous ligaments&mdash;firmly
attached at either end to the adjacent periosteum&mdash;over-stretching,
mostly involving partial rupture, with
swelling, softening, and disintegration of their structure.
It is beyond the purpose of this communication to draw
attention to the plan of treatment adopted by Bone-setters
under these circumstances; it is, however,
described in a paper of mine, of which an abstract is
given in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, of September 25th,
1880. The stiffness of a sprained joint is partial. The
surface is generally cold, or more or less œmatous, and
each joint has one particular spot in which pressure
causes acute pain; the Bone-setters have learned by
experience the situation of these spots, and this fact has
done more than anything to strengthen the popular
faith in their intuitive skill; they certainly form an
important guide to treatment since they indicate the seat
of greatest injury to the ligaments, and point out where
their power of passive resistance has been most severely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
tested, and where adhesions are most likely to have
formed, Dr. Hood, in his record of Mr. Hutton’s practice,
has enumerated some of these painful spots, the
chief of them are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Over the head of the femur in the centre of the
groin, corresponding to the ilio-femoral band of the capsular
ligament (which is most severely stretched when the
thigh is over extended, as when the trunk is flung violently
backwards the commonest cause of a sprained hip).</p>

<p>2.&mdash;For the knee joint, at the back of the lower edge
of the internal condyle, in other words, at the posterior
border of the internal lateral ligament where it blends
with Winslow’s ligament, and where the senior membranosus
tendon is in intimate relation with it. These parts
suffer most because as Mr. Morris says: ‘During extension
they resist rotation outwards of the tibia upon a
vertical axis’ and a sprained knee is almost always
caused by a twist outwards of the foot.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;For the shoulder at the point corresponding to the
bicipital groove, because in nine cases out of ten a man
sprains his shoulder to prevent himself from falling, his
hand grasps the nearest support, the body is violently
abducted from the arm, the long head of the biceps is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
called upon to exert its utmost restraining power, the
bicipital fascia is overstretched, and the tendon very
often displaced.</p>

<p>Again for the elbow the painful place is at the front of
the tip of the internal condyle; the fan-shaped internal
lateral ligament has its apex at that point, and it is most
stretched in over-supination, with extreme extension of
the forearm. On the front of the external malleolus, at
the apex of the plantar arch, the tip of the fifth metatarsal
bone, the styloid process of the ulna, the inside
of the thumb, and the annular ligament in the front
of the wrist, are respectively the most painful spots
when those joints are severally sprained.</p>

<p>The manipulative part of the treatment of joints stiff
from being sprained may be briefly said to consist in
pressure over the part most injured, and momentary
extension of the limb, followed by sudden forcible flexion.
The method varies with each joint, and I can with confidence
refer you to Dr. Wharton Hood as being faithful
word-pictures, supplemented, too, by very accurate
drawings.</p>

<p>The following are some of the lesser injuries, the non-recognition
of which has frequently come under my notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
at Whitworth. In the upper limb: fracture of the tip of
the acromion; practical luxation of the acromio-clavicular
and sterno-clavicular joints (often happening to men
who carry weights on their shoulders); partial dislocation
of the long head of the biceps, with over extension of the
bicipital fascia (common in men who throw weights or use
a shovel as malsters or navvies). Dislocation of the head
of the radius forward on the condyle, which is very
common in children, and has a marked tendency to cause
stiff elbows; fracture of the tip of the internal condyle;
overlooked Colles’ fracture; partial luxation of the head
of the ulna (impeding supination of the hand, and having
a tendency to gradually grow worse); severe sprain at
the carpo-metacarpal joint of the thumb (very common
in stone masons and caused by the ‘jar’ of heavy chisels).</p>

<p>In the lower limb: Fracture of the fibula, just above
the malleolus and at its tip (these are fruitful sources of
lameness, often overlooked, and, if of old standing, very
troublesome to treat); partial rupture of the ligamentum
patellæ at its insertion into the tubercle of the
tibia, which is much more common than is ordinarily
supposed; neglected over-stretching of the ligament of
the plantar arch, and tearing of the plantar ligament at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
its insertion into the os-calcis; rupture of the penniform
muscular attachments of the tendo Achillis and muscular
hernia in the calf.</p>

<p>I trust I shall be forgiven if I have dwelt too much on
the <i>étourderie</i> of some of us, but I am sure so-called
<i>trifling</i> injuries deserve more attention at our hands, since
living at the high pressure men do now-a-days, with
every part of their bodies tested to its utmost capacity,
the slightest impairment of the mechanism of a limb
must be an incalculable source of personal annoyance,
discomfort, or disability.</p>

<p>“When doctors disagree who shall decide?” The
readers of this little manual will probably say as they
read Mr. Dacre Fox’s paper, that it is alike a testimony
and a vindication of the “Art of the Bone-setter.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />

<small><i>WHAT BONE-SETTERS CURE.</i></small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“Man’s life, Sir, being so short, and then the way that
leads unto the knowledge of ourselves, so long and tedious;
each minute should be precious.”&mdash;<i>Beaumont and Fletcher.</i></p></blockquote>

<hr class="short" />
<p>Throughout the many references to the Bone-setter and
his art, which I have quoted in the foregoing pages, the
Bone-setter is constantly misrepresented. He is described
as a man of one idea, one formula, and one mode
of operation. His ruling idea is said to be that a “bone
is out” in all cases submitted to him. His formula to
wrench the joint so as to break adhesions, and to replace
the bones in their normal conditions. His mode of
operation is said to be brute-force suddenly applied.
Nothing can be further from the truth. It is an offhand
generalization from a few cases out of thousands,
and therefore misleading. If these statements were true
there would be but few who would trust themselves and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>their painful limbs to the Bone-setter’s care lest his
force should be applied in the wrong direction. A
brother Bone-setter (Mr. J. M. Jackson, of Boston), has
pointed out how irrational and absurd Mr. Hood’s
statements on the one hand and admissions on the other
necessarily are. Bonesetters, as a rule, are as regular
and legitimate in their practice as any medical man can
be, though they are not recognised by law. As Mr.
Jackson truly says: “All kinds of fractures and dislocations,
and other injuries are constantly being placed
under their care and treatment, with the utmost confidence
on the part of the patients and their friends; a
confidence inspired by indisputable success on the part of
a practitioner in a given locality and district, for a series
of years&mdash;it may be for a lifetime.” Mr. Jackson, in
his timely little pamphlet, very truly points out that
“living reasons” for this confidence can be found in
town and country where the practice has been carried on,
or who have experienced the greatest benefits under the
skilful treatment of the Bone-setter, even after the
wisdom of the faculty had declared there was nothing
wrong. That such men are ignorant of anatomy, and
but seldom have dislocations under their care, and, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
when they have, and succeed in replacing the joint, that it
is done unconsciously, and what they do is the result of
blind chance and ‘sudden movement’ without any
knowledge of how, or why such results are brought
about; the idea is ridiculous in the extreme; upon this
hypothesis the practitioner would nearly approach the
“supernatural!” I am glad to record this opinion, because
it not only reflects the opinion of the public, but shows
that the faculty have tried to prove too much. The
position of the Bone-setter may be clearly defined, thus:&mdash;“<i>We
lay no claim to skill beyond what is the result of
sound original teaching, thoughtful consideration, and
common sense</i>,” and we possess well-earned reputations
won in proof that we have succeeded in our special
practice.</p>

<p>Even at the risk of being classed by the present, or
some future Dr. Howard Marsh, as being amongst those
sophisticated Bone-setters, “who keep a skeleton in the
cupboard,” or a few bones to amuse the credulous, I
cannot close this little manual without saying something
about the bones of the human skeleton. Throughout
the extracts I have quoted from surgical and other
writers, reference is made to the various parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
body, where bones are fractured, or “put out.” These
bones are mentioned by their scientific names, and
may be as <i>caviare to the million</i>. I have therefore
inserted a rough engraving of a skeleton, plate
I., pp. 1 which cannot offend the susceptibilities of
surgeons, for it is one which is placed in the hands of
the students of the ambulance classes of the Order of St.
John of Jerusalem, in England. It will be observed
that the skeleton is divided into three parts. 1. The Head;
2. The Trunk; and 3. The Limbs, i.&mdash;The <i>Head</i>
has the skull-cap and face. ii.&mdash;The <i>Trunk</i>, the back-bone,
breast-bone, with the ribs. iii.&mdash;The Limbs; the
shoulders and arms; the haunches and legs. The
shoulders and arms are the origin of prehension, whilst
the haunches and legs form the origin of support and
progression. The skull is composed of eight and the face
of fourteen bones. The facial bones, except the lower
jaw, are firmly pressed together. The latter is the one
subject to dislocation.</p>

<p>The Trunk is divided into 1.&mdash;The thorax, or chest.
2.&mdash;The abdomen, or belly. 3.&mdash;The pelvis.</p>

<p>The bones of the Thorax, are i.&mdash;The spine (behind).
ii.&mdash;The sternum, or breast-bone (in front); and iii.&mdash;The
ribs and the cartilages (at sides). The <i>Spine</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
divided into five parts. There are seven bones in the
<i>Cervical</i> or neck portion. Twelve bones in the <i>Dorsal</i>
or back portion. Five bones in the <i>Lumbar</i> or lower
portion. There are five bones fixed into one in the
<i>Sacrum</i> or rump bone. The incipient tail, this <i>Os Coccyx</i>
terminates the column.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sternum</span>, or breast-bone, forms the front of the
chest; it has attached to either side a collar-bone and the
cartilages of seven upper ribs.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ribs</span> are twelve pairs of bony arches forming the
walls of the chest. They are all attached behind to the
spine. The upper seven are termed <i>true</i> ribs, being fixed
to the breast-bone by their cartilages: the lower five are
termed <i>floating</i> or <i>false</i> ribs, having no attachment in
front.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Abdomen</span> is supported behind by the lumbar spine,
and below by the bones of the pelvis.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pelvis</span> is the basin-shaped cavity which forms
the lowest portion of the trunk; and contains the bladder,
the internal organs of generation, part of the intestines,
and several great blood-vessels and nerves. The pelvis
is composed of four bones&mdash;<i>2 Innominate or haunch-bones.</i>
<i>1 Sacrum or rump-bone.</i> <i>1 Coccyx.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Innominate</span> or haunch-bones, with the lower
portion of spine (sacrum and coccyx), form the lowest
portion of the trunk. The innominate bones on their
outer surfaces have cup-like depressions for the reception
of the heads of the thigh-bones.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Shoulder</span> is formed by the <i>clavicle</i> or <i>collar-bone</i>
and <i>scapula</i> or <i>blade-bone</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Clavicle</span>, or collar-bone, has a double curve; it
marks the line dividing the neck and chest.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Scapula</span>, or blade-bone, lies on the back of the
chest, is of a triangular shape, and forms the socket for
the humerus or arm-bone.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Upper Limb</span> comprises&mdash;1 <i>Humerus</i>, arm-bone.
2 <i>Radius and Ulna</i>, fore-arm. 8 <i>Carpus</i>, wrist. <i>Metacarpus</i>,
palm. <i>Phalanges</i>, finger-bones.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Humerus</span>, or bone of upper arm, extends from
the shoulder to the elbow; above, it is joined to the
scapula, and below to the bones of fore-arm.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ulna</span> is the larger bone of the fore-arm, lies on
the inside, and extends from elbow to wrist.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Radius</span> lies on the outside of the fore-arm.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Carpus</span> is a double row of small bones which help
to form the wrist-joint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Metacarpus</span> consists of five bones, and forms the
body of the hand.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Phalanges</span> are the fourteen finger-bones.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lower Limb</span> is composed as follows:&mdash;1 <i>Femur</i>,
thigh-bone. 1 <i>Patella</i>, knee-cap. 2 <i>Tibia and Fibula</i>,
leg-bones. 7 <i>Tarsus</i>, ankle-bones. 5 <i>Metatarsus</i>, instep-bones.
14 <i>Phalanges</i>, toe-bones.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hip</span> joint is a ball-socket joint, and is somewhat
similar to the joint at the shoulder.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Femur</span>, or thigh-bone, extends from hip to knee
joint, both of which joins it helps to form.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Patella</span> (<i>knee-cap</i>) is the small oval bone which
forms the prominent point of knee.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Knee Joint</span> is formed by the lower end of femur,
the patella, and the upper end of the tibia.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Tibia</span> is the main bone of the leg, and extends
from knee to ankle, on the inside of the limb.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fibula</span> is the small bone on the outside of the
limb: the lower ends of the tibia and fibula form
prominent projections at the sides of the ankle.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Tarsus</span>, ankle-bones, are seven irregular shaped
bones, firmly united together; above they are attached to
the tibia and fibula, and in front to the metatarsus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Metatarsus</span> forms the instep, and together with
the tarsus the arch of the foot.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Phalanges</span>, bones of the toes, are fourteen in
number, two for the great toe, and three for each of the
others.</p>

<p>These bones are liable to be broken, dislocated, or
fractured by violence. Fractures or broken bones, they
are usually divided into four classes, which are termed&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1.&mdash;Simple fracture, a simple break.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Compound fracture, a flesh wound commencing
with the broken ends of the bone.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Complicated fracture, injuries to soft parts, blood
vessels, nerves, or internal organs.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Comminuted fracture, smashing of bones into pieces.</p></blockquote>

<p>They vary very much in extent and form. Some are
very simple indeed, and there is but little perceptible
looseness of the ends of the fractured part or sign of
fracture. A case of this kind might easily be mistaken
for a mere contusion, which has often been done.
Bones are often broken obliquely, and with sharp points,
and require skilful treatment both in reduction and the
application of splints. Compound fractures, of course,
require care and skill, but many fractures are so easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
to understand and rectify, that all is required is a little
common sense treatment.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">SYMPTOMS</span> of fracture are:&mdash;1. Alterations in
shape and general appearance (plate V., fig. 88., pp. xix).&mdash;2.
Unusual mobility at seat of fracture.&mdash;3. Crepitus or
crackling in placing hand over the broken part and
creating motion with the other.&mdash;4. Shortening of limb.&mdash;5.
Some inequality felt on moving the fingers along
the surface of the injured bone.</p>

<p>These have to be distinguished from dislocations, and
in doing so, the following facts must be remembered:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="fractures" border="0"><tr>
<td class="tdc padr4"><i>Fractures.</i></td>
<td class="tdc padr4"><i>Dislocations.</i></td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Crepitus.</td><td class="tdl">No crepitus.</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Unnaturally movable.</td><td class="tdl">More or less fixed.</td></tr><tr>

<td class="tdl padr2"><p class="indent">Seat of injury in the shaft or body of the bone.</p></td><td class="tdl vertt">Seat of injury at a joint.</td>
</tr></table>

<p><span class="smcap">Dislocations</span> are partial or complete. Partial dislocations
are most common and most difficult to understand,
as the ordinary signs are not so clear as in complete
dislocations, and may be overlooked or misunderstood,
but as Mr. Jackson has before pointed out to the
experienced Bone-setter, symptoms, which cannot be
described appear; and motions, or want of motions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
equally unexplainable, are felt, so that he has very little
difficulty in determining the nature of the injury.</p>

<p>Partial dislocations, displacements of tendons, and
other injuries of a similar character, may sometimes be
rectified a considerable time after the injury has been
sustained, but should be attended to within a short time
after the accident&mdash;at least, within a few days. Much,
however, depends upon the nature of the injury, that no
definite time can be given which the patient may take
before seeking proper advice.</p>

<p>Many of the cases so graphically described in “Chambers’
Journal” and Dr. Hood’s book were evidently not
complete dislocations, but partial dislocations of joints or
displaced ligaments, etc., which admitted of being rectified
by dexterous manipulation.</p>

<p>In plate II., figs. 1 and 2, I have given the appearances
of a dislocated thumb and a dislocated finger (2) a very
common form of accident; fig. 3 shows the radius of the
arm fixed forward; fig. 4 shows the dislocation of the
radius at the elbow-joint; and fig. 5 the dislocation of
the humerus or upper arm-bone at the shoulder joint;
figs. 6 and 7 the appearances of a dislocated shoulder-joint;
fig. 8 shows the radius dislocated forward a dislo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>cated
elbow; fig. 9 is a painful and yet not uncommon accident,
and one that frequently comes under the Bone-setter’s
care, whilst fig. 8 shows the dislocation of the
radius forward; fig. 10, plate III, page 35, shows its
appearance backward.</p>

<p>The dislocation of the jaw is a laughable accident to
all but the sufferer (fig. 11), unfortunately it is liable to
recur at any time when the patient is laughing or gaping.</p>

<p>The hip is likely to be dislocated by the jerking of the
body. Figs. 12 and 13 show two modes in which this
accident may present itself when the “hip is out.” It
is as well to lay the patient on the bed and pack the
knee with cushions or pillows so as to relieve the pain.
The manner of packing will depend upon the form of
dislocation or injury, but the position in which the
patient lies the easiest is best, and in that position it
should be supported. Bran poultices should be applied;
scald the bran in hot water, or steam it, then put it into
a bag and lay it upon the hip as warm as it can be borne,
and repeat it until advice can be procured.</p>

<p>Plate IV, page 68, gives representations of five
varieties of dislocation. The dislocated shoulder joint is
shown at fig. 14. If the elbow hangs off from the side,
which will be the case if the dislocation is downwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
it is well to place a small cushion between the elbows and
the sides and place the arm in a sling. The dislocations
of the first, inwards or outwards (figures 15 and 16), are
very painful and are frequently accompanied with
sprains. Figs. 17 and 18 show the dislocation of the
knee and elbow joint and fig. 29, a curious dislocation of
the vertebræ of the neck and arm.</p>

<p>In treating of fractures, two points have to be considered;
1.&mdash;To reduce the fractured ends or portions to
their natural positions; secondly, to retain them there
immovable till nature has effected a permanent cure, or
otherwise the result will be similar to fig. 19, plate V.
It should be borne in mind that there is no urgency
in treating a broken limb, provided no attempt is made to
remove the person, but if the patient must be moved in
the absence of a skilled “Bone-setter,” it is an absolute
necessity to secure the limb by putting it in splints, which
can be easily extemporised in the manner taught in the
ambulance classes of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>A stretcher is the only safe means of conveyance for
cases of fracture. Unskilful handling may cause either
serious mischief or even loss of life; the dangers are
pressing the sharp ends through the flesh, blood-vessels,
nerves, or into some internal organ, such as the lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<h3>SPECIAL FRACTURES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the Skull</span> is caused by blows or falls.
The external signs are not always present. In fracture of
the base there may be hæmorrhage from ear, mouth, or
nose; red patches of blood under conjuctivæ of eyes;
and oozing of watery fluid from the ears. Accompanying
these there may be symptoms of concussion, or
symptoms of compression.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> Place the patient in a dark and quiet
room on his back, with head slightly raised. Apply cold
to head as soon as reaction sets in and patient gets hot
and feverish, and send for a surgeon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of Lower Jaw</span> (Fig. 23, plate V.), is
caused by direct blows; falls on chin. The symptoms
are irregularity in the line of the teeth and the outline of
the lower margin of bone; inability to move jaw. The
treatment is simple. First fix lower jaw to upper jaw
by a bandage, until the Bone-setter or surgeon connects
the fractured parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of Collar-Bone</span> is caused by blows on
shoulder; falls on elbow or hand. It is a frequent accident,
and when it occurs the shoulder sometimes drops;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
finger along the arm is helpless, and there is an irregularity
on drawing surface of bone; a pad should be
placed in arm-pit, bind the arm to side just above elbow,
and sling forearm, as when a “shoulder is out.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures of Ribs</span> are variously caused by blows,
falls, weight passing over chest or back; there is pain and
difficulty in breathing, and the usual signs of fracture.
All that can be done at first is to apply a broad roller
bandage firmly round chest, so as to prevent all movement;
or strap the injured side with adhesive plaster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the Humerus</span> (Fig. 21). It is caused
by direct falls on elbow (fig. 26). The symptoms are mobility
at seat of fracture, crepitus, or crackling, shortening,
usually present when fracture is oblique, as in fig. 25.
Apply first a roller bandage from hand to elbow, abduct
arm and apply three or four splints from shoulder to
elbow. Support arm in a sling. If there is looseness
about the part apply a splint; if the flesh is broken stop
the bleeding as directed elsewhere; if, however (as is
often the case in a fracture of the forearm), there is no
particular looseness of the bones, the case may be treated
as dislocations and injuries to muscles, ligaments, &amp;c.
(see page 36.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of the Forearm</span> is variously caused by
direct violent blows, falls, &amp;c. The symptoms are
crepitus, mobility, alteration in shape of arm (fig. 27),
and in treating it, semiflex forearm with thumb pointing
outwards. Apply two splints, one in front from bend of
elbow to the tips of the fingers, and one behind from
elbow to knuckles. The splints should be well padded.
Place arm in sling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures about Wrist and Hand</span> are caused by
blows or other injuries. There is pain, swelling, irregularity
in the outline of the bones and crepitus. The
limb must be bandaged to a flat board or splint, and
supported by sling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures of Femur or Thigh-bone</span> (fig. 24) are
caused by blows or falls, and pain and loss of power is
instantly felt with crepitus, shortening, or the broken
ends may be felt and the foot turned out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures</span> (both of the leg or thigh).&mdash;First straighten
the limb if bent, then tie a handkerchief round the fractured
part, after which place a splint made of a broad
lath, or something like it, from one joint to the other&mdash;say
from the knee to the hip, if it is a broken thigh&mdash;and
then tie handkerchiefs above and below the fracture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
near the ends of the splint, tie the limbs together at the
ankles, knees, and elsewhere, so that one supports the
other. The object is to prevent motion of the fracture
while the injured person is being moved, either to home
or hospital. In doing this care should be taken to avoid
jolting or shaking, as far as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fracture of Patella or Knee-Cap</span> (fig. 33) may
be caused by blows, or excessive muscular action, and the
person is made to stand upon leg first. Fragments can
also be felt. Raise limb to a position at right angles
to body, and apply a figure-of-eight bandage around the
knee, including the fragments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures of Bones of the Leg</span> (fig. 28), are
frequent from blows, falls, crushing weight, such as
wheels passing over the limb. There is pain and loss of
power; alteration in shape; crepitus, and the broken
ends may be felt. Apply two splints, one inside and one
outside the limb, as directed above, and elevate limb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fractures about Foot and Ankle.</span> These are
various results of blows or other injuries&mdash;(see figs. 30,
31, 36, and 37)&mdash;pain, swelling; alteration in outline of
bones; crepitus. <i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Elevate foot; apply cold
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>It must be remembered that the treatment for
fractures here given is only temporary, to enable the
patient to be moved without further injury, which
might result in the loss of the limb or even life,
till advice can be had.</p>

<p>When the fractured bone protrudes through the flesh,
and there is much bleeding, first straighten the limb and
close the wound, and tie a handkerchief tightly round
over the wound, until a pad can be made, then as
quickly as possible make a pad by folding old rags or
cloth, or anything of the kind to be got closely together,
of some thickness, and broad enough to cover the
wound well, then remove the handkerchief already tied
on, and place the pad over the wound and tie it lightly,
so that the pad presses hard upon the wound and stops
the bleeding; the bandage or handkerchief cannot well
be too tight. Many a life might be saved, which is now
lost if this or a similar method were adopted promptly.
The materials are almost always at hand, and the
application of them easy and simple. Immediately after
the bleeding is stopped remove the sufferer, and call in
professional advice without delay.</p>

<p>The stoppage of bleeding from arteries is taught prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>tically
in the ambulance classes, and though it forms no
part of the Bone-setter’s art, yet many a life may be,
and has been saved by this little knowledge, so I subjoin
the directions given in the hand-book of the order of St.
John, by the lamented Surgeon-Major Sheppard, whose
humanity cost him his life after the battle of Isandula.</p>

<p class="indent2"><small>“<i>The following situation of the main arteries in the
different regions of the body, and their treatment
when wounded.</i>”</small></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Region of the Head</span> there is the <i>Temporal
Artery</i> in front of ear, one <i>P. Auricular</i> at the back of
ear at the <i>Occipital</i>, back of head. Compress over the
wound, and bandage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Neck</span> the <i>Carotid Arteries</i> ascend in a line
from inner ends of collar-bones to angles of jaw. Digital
compression in line of vessels above and below the
wound, or directly into wound on the mouths of the
bleeding vessels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Armpit</span>, the <i>Auxiliary Artery</i> lies across
hollow space of armpit. Compress subclavian artery
behind middle of collar-bone, or digital pressure into the
wound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Upper Arm</span>, the <i>Brachial Artery</i> lies on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
inner side of arm, in a line with seam on coat sleeve&mdash;from
inner fold of armpit to middle of bend of elbow.
Compress artery by a tourniquet above wound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Fore-Arm</span> the <i>Radial and Ulnar Arteries</i>
begin below the middle of bend of elbow, and descend
one on each side of the front of the arm to the wrist.
Compress Brachial artery in the upper arm by a tourniquet,
<i>or</i> place a pad in hollow of elbow and bend fore-arm
against arm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Palm of the Hand</span>, the <i>Radial and Ulnar
Arteries</i> give a number of branches, which spread out and
supply the palm. Apply two small firm pads to arteries
at wrist, or forcibly close and fix hand over a piece of
stick or hard substance, and bandage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Thigh</span>, the <i>Femoral Artery</i>, from middle of
fold of groin runs down the inside of thigh in its upper
two-thirds. Pressure at middle of fold of groin, with
fingers or by tourniquet above wound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Ham</span>, the <i>Popliteal Artery</i> lies along the
middle of ham. Compress popliteal artery above wound,
or compress femoral artery in front of thigh by
tourniquet.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Back of the Leg</span> are the <i>Post</i>, <i>Tibial</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
<i>Peroneal Arteries</i> descend the back and outside of leg
from below ham, passing behind ankle-bones. Compress
at ham or in front of thigh or double leg on thigh with
a pad in the ham.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Front of the Leg and Instep</span> the <i>Anter. Tibial
Artery</i> descends along middle of front of leg and instep.
Compress artery above wound.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Sole of the Foot</span> the <i>Post. Tibial and Peroneal
Arteries</i> descend behind ankle-bones; the former
supplies branches, which spread out on sole of foot. Compress
by a pad behind inner ankle-bone; if this fails,
place pads behind outer ankle-bone and on middle of
front of the ankle.</p>

<p>In dislocations generally, and displacement of cartilage,
tendons &amp;c., and also sprains and bruises, flannels soaked
in warm water may be applied frequently, or warm bran
poultices. This kind of treatment will almost always be
suitable in the first instance. After some time has
elapsed, when a little inflammation sets in, which mostly
occurs some hours after the injury has been sustained,
apply cloths soaked in cold water or cooling lotion, and
repeat them as often as they get dry; if they are pleasant
when applied, that will be an indication that they are
suitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>Displacement of cartilage, tendons, and similar injuries
as Mr. Jackson points out are of frequent occurrence,
and require very close attention and considerable experience
to understand them. Theory is quite insufficient
of itself to enable an operator to ascertain the
nature of, and rectify the displacement. Such cases may
be remedied by a simple manipulation, but it must be a
carefully studied one, and acquired by constant practice.</p>

<p>Another form of accident is that of ruptured muscles
which frequently come under the Bone-setter’s care;
an illustration of a ruptured biceps is given in fig. 35
and fig. 38, shows the <i>rectus femioris</i> rupture.</p>

<p>These useful hints can hardly be called superfluous in
a manual on the art of the Bone-setter, which is admittedly
“a neglected corner of the domain of surgery.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the foregoing pages I have quoted the testimony of
many persons of eminence who have been relieved of
their ailments and cured by the art of the Bone-setter,
when regular surgeons have failed to accomplish that
desirable result. One, at least, of the cases thus published
was contributed by one of my own patients without my
knowledge. I have thought it my duty in vindicating
my special art to give prominence to the opinion of
others. I have shown how the sneers of the faculty have
been turned to doubts, and under many who went forth
to scoff at the despised “Bone-setter” remained to pray.
Our so-called secrets have been appropriated and pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>lished,

and many clergymen and gentlemen of reputation

from day to day and from week to week seek relief at

<p>“My dear Sir,&mdash;It was only yesterday that I could catch
the wife of Richard Wood, of Albrighton, to give me particulars
of his accident, of his lameness, and your care. He is about 50
years old. It was in April, 1880, that he “sprained” (or I
believe rather dislocated somehow) his foot by its turning on one
side when he trod on and slipped from a brick. He had his
club doctor, who treated it and called it a sprain, sent lotion, &amp;c.
But for 17 weeks he could not tread on it, and was in pain all
the time. Then me hearing of it sent him to you in August.
He was driven to the station at Albrighton, and from Snow Hill
to Bullivant’s Hotel, where you saw him, moved his foot up
and down, then gave a strong jerk up, it snacked, and you
bandaged it, and he walked up and down the room for the first
time after the accident! He came again to you a fortnight after
driving to the Albrighton Station, and from Snow Hill to your
Hotel. But he walked back to the station by your permission;
his wife accompanied him both times. He came once more to
show you his foot a fortnight after that, but his wife did not
think it necessary to accompany him, and he walked both ways
without feeling any the worse.</p>

<p>It was not till April, 1881, that he went regularly to work
again, and he has continued at it without intermission.”</p>

to your skill. Having been under Dr. Deyons, of Fenny Stratford,
with fracture and dislocation of elbow for three months,
and who left me at that time a complete cripple, I was not able
to feed myself or do anything at my trade. I then had advice
from two prominent medical doctors of this town, but neither
would undertake the operation, and the advice received from
both was go to Guy’s Hospital. I then presented myself to you,
and you have succeeded far better than I anticipated, for I am
now able to work at my trade and earn my living, and my arm
is getting stronger every day.</p>

I am, gratefully yours,<span class="h">xxxxxx</span>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;About twelve months ago I was suffering from
pains in my left shoulder which I thought was rheumatism.
After waiting about four months I consulted my medical man,
who said the collar-bone was broken. He set it and attended
me about a month. Being no better I was advised to go to you.
You told me it had not been broken, but that the ligaments of
the shoulder were contracted, and I could not got my hand
higher than my head. After your treatment and advice I am
happy to say it is now well and strong, and had it not been for
your skill, I feel sure I should have lost the use of it.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I have great pleasure in stating I am quite sound
again. Also allow me to state I have every confidence in your
skill as a practical Bone-setter. You relieved me after suffering
for two months with dislocation of my knee. I could not get
my heel to the ground till one Sunday morning (which I shall
never forget) when I sent for you and you put my knee in. I
was able to walk at once free from pain. I had been under our
local surgeon some time and received no benefit.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;It is with much pleasure that I write to thank
you for your kindness and skilful attention to my arm. I may
mention on the 10th of October, 1882, I was thrown from my
bicycle near Dunchurch, and severely fractured my left elbow.
I saw a surgeon at Stratford-on-Avon on the 12th and 16th of
October after the accident, who said there was no fracture or
dislocation. Not feeling satisfied, my employer gave me a ticket
to go into the Kidderminster Hospital. The doctor there told
me my elbow was ruined for life&mdash;that I should have a stiff
joint; the thought of it gave me an awful turn, knowing that
the means of earning my living would be very much impaired.
I therefore made up my mind to go to you, and am now very
thankful I did go, for after two months of your skilful treatment
I can use my arm again quite freely. I find it no detriment to
my work whatever, and am able to follow my occupation as well
as before the accident.</p>

<p>With very many thanks, I remain,</p>
<p class="right">
Yours very gratefully,<span class="h">xxxxxx</span><br />

<p>John Knight wishes to say that he has every confidence in
Mr. Matthews Bennett’s skill having been under his treatment
several times with broken bones and dislocations, the last of
which was a fracture of both thighs and a collar bone caused
by a fall of earth in a coal pit belonging to Mr. Newdegate, M.P.,
January 2, 1875, and with God’s blessing and Mr. Bennett’s kind
skill and attention he is now perfectly well.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
